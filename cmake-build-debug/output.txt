472: after her own room, makes her fret.
473: after Saint Chariton's gone past
474: after that, supper's served, and so
475: after the martyr's price it paid,
476: after two minutes, off again,
477: after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
478: again I see your soulful flight?
479: against each other swift, small feet.
480: against the tea's excessive sweetness,
481: aged Derzhávin1 saw and blessed us
482: ages we'd never heard of love:
483: Agree, the way Eugene proceeded
484: Ah, all that my Onegin knew...
485: Ah, gently, gently, easy goes --
486: Ah, he had loved a love that never
487: Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
488: alarmed by my melodious lay,
489: Alas for him! there was no keeping
490: Alas! the generations must,
491: Alas, Eugene beyond all query
492: Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
493: Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
494: Alas, our youth was what we made it,
495: album and stays, Princess Alina,
496: all a pure maiden's love was breathing.
497: All are dumbfounded. Lensky shies
498: all blend into Eugene alone.
499: all brought to life at your direction.
500: all day, all night, his presence fills her,
501: all egoistical and dry,
502: All flourishing; they send their duty.
503: all for our tender dreamy maiden
504: all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
505: All in good time, on each point I
506: All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,
507: all modish foes dread worldly shame.
508: all of an emptiness so killing -- >
509: all others with a waistcoat's set
510: all plunged his soul deep in the stream
511: all point at her, and all combine
512: All right, you want the resurrection
513: All rights reserved
514: all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
515: All sleep: from the saloon a roaring
516: all sorts of hopeless appetites;
517: all stand. He walks towards the door.
518: all that today we find absurd.
519: all these are charming! but to put
520: All this has now gone out of fashion,
521: all this, at eighteen years of age,
522: all was material for transcribing:
523: All who behold him find him strange.
524: all's well; the destined hour at last
525: allow no rest to you or me;
526: allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
527: allows no comfort to come through --
528: almanacs, journals of reflection,
529: almost as good as a dim lamp.
530: alone across the fields of space,
531: Alone amid all his possessions,
532: alone with him; Onegin takes her
533: alone, and sunk in calculation,
534: alone, with no adornment on;
535: Along the fronts of darkened houses,
536: along the Neva in a sleigh,
537: along the street lies dirty snow;
538: along the street where slumber drowses,
539: along Tverskaya Street already
540: Already borne down by regret,
541: already high in treason's league!
542: Already now the talk was thriving
543: Already Olga's hand was gripping
544: already she'd assume ill-luck.
545: already silvering all the plain...
546: already stirred him as they should.
547: already studying to intrigue,
548: already tends too much to smile
549: already there she stands beside him;
550: already yawned before the show,
551: Already, in exultant fashion,
552: although it's nearly heard the knell,
553: although one in no manner shares
554: although there are no streets, no cards,
555: always before the volume ended
556: always comes back: I'll not be wedded.
557: always contented with his life,
558: always monotonously gay,
559: Always our fervid hero tended

568: Amidst the hills, down in that valley,
569: amidst the howling and the blast
570: among my friends, in all that crowd
571: among the guests a general dinning:
572: among the guests she recognized
573: among the maidens and the wives,
574: among the neighbours round about.
575: amongst devout coquettes, appalling
576: amongst the crafty and small-minded,
577: amusing, flattering with the best,
578: an ace a dozen yards away;
579: an album's loose and floating sheaves.
580: an elegy to her address,
581: an eloquence of fevered strength,
582: an idle monk in glum seclusion,
583: an inn at each stage of the route.
584: an ode in twenty-five cantos.
585: an offering ready for the ground.
586: an old man saw her as she came,
587: An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
588: an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
589: ancestral1 portraits met the view
590: and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
591: and act the humble or imperious,
592: and after jealousy's grim weather
593: And all grandmothers who are listening
594: and all into the salon squeeze,
595: and all is lost beyond retrieving;
596: and all our fresh imagination,
597: and all our modish education;
598: and all the neighbours planned a match
599: And all the while the moon was shining
600: and all the works of Fontanelle16 --

798: and now a swooning mind attends me,
799: and now at last he saw the World.
800: and now it's Bordeaux the Judicious
801: and now the crunchy snow is stripping
802: And now the door is opened wide,
803: And now the two opponents doff
804: And now there's gradually beginning

862: and set off prompter than a whistle
863: and set on hating the coquette,
864: and sets her gently on the floor.
865: and she, submissively, inertly --
866: and should have played a different part:
867: and shout, and make room for the pair.
868: and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
869: and sideways her poor head is stooping.
870: and sighs, and asks oneself all through:

873: and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
874: and sleeping sounder than a rock.
875: and slowly day begins to climb.
876: and so he lacks the strength to mention
877: and so in the salons could make
878: and so in winter-fields will shiver
879: and so the harmless chat progresses
880: And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
881: and so your faithfullest supporter
882: And so, at last, feature by feature,
883: and so, before the world of learning,
884: and some were even testifying
885: And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
886: and soon his travels had begun,
887: and soon they bring her... a guitar
888: and soon will day's bright tune be played;
889: and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
890: and stately periwigs, their fame.

902: and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes

910: and the blancmanger, then a fleet
911: and the churchyard where, new-erected,
912: and the deep-throated billows' choric
913: and the derivative Knyazhnín:8
914: and the majestic, antlered royal,
915: and the poet, without a sound,
916: and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
917: And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
918: and the young city-bred newcomer,

920: and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
921: and then a drozhky's clopping sound
922: and then a stroll in Letny Park.
923: and then concludes: she loves him yet!
924: and then it's tea that comes to mention,
925: and then old cousin Pelagéya
926: and then sat silent all the way.
927: And then she broods and mopes for good,
928: and then, indoors the livelong day,

937: and though my muse may be capricious,
938: and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
939: and though to do so would be daring,

955: and up the rustling curtain crawls.
956: and useful goods of every kind.

959: and walk, and breathe, before I tell

961: and washed its face, to her brought word
962: and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.

981: and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
982: and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''

989: and with its feeble glow outlining
990: and with no post, no work, no wife,
991: and with the decorous throng to follow
992: and wore his dressing-gown to dine.

999: and yet inseparably present,
1000: and yet so light. All that is real
1001: And yet that goddess whom I'd never

1117: At first I thought it out of season
1118: at first Madame gave him tuition,

1123: at first, with God knows whom to see,

1127: at hours, which, why I cannot think,
1128: at last alone, and quite forgetting
1129: At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
1130: at last the final hours arrive.
1131: At last, with dawn upon him, stooping
1132: at least by a regretful kindness;
1133: at least her tone is sometimes found
1134: At least I'll give him some advice:
1135: At least you then showed for my years
1136: at length, midst children swarming round him,
1137: at my famed portrait and will say:
1138: at noontime does his horn resound
1139: At once Anisia came to greet her,
1140: at once they give a man the spleen.
1141: at soldier-husbands, and the drum.
1142: at some dull aunt's, sat down and knew
1143: at such vivacious, free good sense.
1144: at sunken wax inside a bowl:
1145: at the Academic Diction-book.
1146: at the same moment in her ear:
1147: at thirty, lucratively wed;

1173: bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
1174: bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,
1175: beauty with all its heavenly spell,
1176: became like brother knit to brother.
1177: became their scrutiny's concern.
1178: because some glance of his has bitten
1179: become a joke to us, its game,
1180: becomes a horse for all to see;

1186: before a fire too slowly flaming,
1187: before first light they have appointment,
1188: before him roast beef, red and gory,
1189: before his eyes, imagination
1190: before it was the golden play
1191: before my gaze began to pass.
1192: before Onegin there collected
1193: before she goes, she seeks permission
1194: before such candour of expression,
1195: before such playfulness of soul!...
1196: before the clavichord with knitted
1197: before the fire a table's spread;
1198: before the window taking station,
1199: before their eyes they see unfold
1200: before which life's horizon yet
1201: before you on the ground, unhearing,
1202: begot by boredom out of greed.
1203: begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
1204: behind deceit or double-dealing?)
1205: behind her followed wildly dancing;
1206: behind the door the clash of glasses
1207: behind the mill. In solemn talk,

1220: beside his heavier half is snoring.
1221: beside the window-sill, that bed

2000: Grandison, cousin, d'you remember?''
2001: great bard despite his modest trapping,
2002: grew hardened to life's frosty clime;

2004: grey-haired and weak, beneath it only
2005: Griboedov
2006: gripped him no more; soon they were raising
2007: grow cold, and hard, and stiff as stock,

2018: had filled this heart, and detestation
2019: had fortune blest me by prescribing
2020: had gone in no uncertain fashion
2021: had killed his best friend in a duel;

2028: had only debts on which to live.
2029: had ruled out reading, in their place
2030: had with its brilliant mantle crowned --

2033: Happy a hundredfold, whoever
2034: Happy is he who's known its fretful

2062: have other maidens, since you vanished,
2063: have pushed their frontiers further out,
2064: have reunited friend to friend!

2068: have your fill of revelry!
2069: having by her severe demeanour
2070: having decyphered on their brow
2071: he almost begs for absolution,

2084: He destined Olga's hand for me,
2085: he doesn't hear when I address
2086: he dozed away; but when the real
2087: He drained his glass down to the end

2090: he drives there like a bird in flight,
2091: he drives up in and out of season
2092: he ended even your employment;

2094: he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
2095: he failed to join that sharp profession
2096: he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
2097: he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
2098: He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
2099: he fled from their resounding chatter!
2100: He followed them without illusion,
2101: he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
2102: he found Tatyana so attractive,
2103: He found them in some old collection,
2104: he found too much that he regretted:
2105: He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
2106: He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
2107: He gave three balls a year, and rather
2108: he gazed out on the threatening glow.
2109: he goes ahead and parts the motley
2110: He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
2111: He got so used to this immersion,
2112: he had conveyed some moral teaching,
2113: he had the talent of saluting
2114: he has to bring the battle-case.
2115: he heard in stillness and in din
2116: he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
2117: he informed this envoy diplomatic
2118: he killed eight years in such a style,
2119: he knew too well that sort of scene.
2120: He lacked the slightest predilection
2121: he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
2122: He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
2123: he leaves a tender verse behind,
2124: he leaves one morning the hermetic
2125: he leaves the house, calls for his horse
2126: He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
2127: he looks, and sees the hour of day --
2128: he looks, in sweet irresolution,
2129: he loves you... like your kith and kin!
2130: He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
2131: he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
2132: he never took one from the shelf,
2133: He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
2134: He opens up a door. What's that
2135: he reached the stream below the hill;
2136: he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
2137: he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
2138: He reads to Olga on occasion,
2139: he really forced one to admire him --
2140: he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
2141: He rings at once, and what a scurry!
2142: He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
2143: He sang of grief and parting-time,
2144: he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --
2145: He sang of love, to love subjected,
2146: he saw no point in staying on,
2147: he saw that, as in cities, here
2148: He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
2149: he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
2150: He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
2151: he sends a letter, penned with passion.
2152: he sends, a second, then a third.
2153: he should have settled for disarming

2155: He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
2156: he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
2157: he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
2158: he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
2159: he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
2160: he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
2161: he strove to achieve the appropriation
2162: he struggled to bite back the chilling
2163: He sweetened up with fancy's icing
2164: he takes her to a chair, beginning
2165: He thought that Olga'd be confused,
2166: he trembles, knows not what to tell;
2167: he turns away: ``I've had enough --
2168: He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
2169: he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
2170: he warns his man for duty, stressing
2171: He was a good and simple barin;6
2172: he was a menace, and a freak.
2173: he was a poet in his day.
2174: He was convinced, a kindred creature
2175: He was no fool; appreciated
2176: He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
2177: He was the slave of a tenacious,
2178: He was the son of the Comte de Saint-Priest, a French émigré.
2179: He was too young to have been blighted
2180: He was without that dithyrambic
2181: he watched the guests and, as he dined,
2182: he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
2183: he who has cooled down love with parting,
2184: He who has lived and thought is certain
2185: he would have found a normal fate.
2186: He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
2187: he'd drink his coffee, flutter through
2188: He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
2189: he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
2190: he'd listen to the administrator;
2191: he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
2192: he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
2193: he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
2194: he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
2195: he'll charm you with his fine invention,
2196: he'll spend before the looking-glass,
2197: he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
2198: he's a freemason too; for him,
2199: He's always with her: either seated
2200: he's at the club, a real stayer,
2201: he's bowed politely; his attention
2202: he's called you out -- say, in your soul
2203: he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
2204: he's first to toast her in the bowl,
2205: He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
2206: he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
2207: He's gone away and left his village,
2208: he's got consumption. In his anguish
2209: he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
2210: He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
2211: he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
2212: he's left sad footprints on the ground.
2213: he's lost his self-command, and crazed
2214: he's moved... you see him from the side.''
2215: He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
2216: He's off -- this ruthless legislator
2217: he's put belle Tatiana instead.
2218: he's racing millward like a bird.
2219: he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
2220: he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
2221: he's viewed the boxes without passion,
2222: hear my confession as I stand
2223: hear, once more filled with inspiration,
2224: heartfelt, imploring, touching trash
2225: heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;
2226: heeding the press, will make us look
2227: Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
2228: held in constraint by pity's touch:
2229: hell's terrifying imprecation:
2230: helping the poor, or while I mended
2231: henceforth in front of you I weep,
2232: her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring
2233: her bow, as calm and as restrained.
2234: her clever husband on the morrow
2235: her darling foot of its wet shoe,
2236: her discomposure, her confusion,
2237: her drops of tears, and seated there,
2238: Her eyes along the margin flitting
2239: her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
2240: Her eyes were opened, and she said

2247: her full account of voiceless pain?
2248: her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
2249: her golden earrings off and whipping;
2250: her grief, and nearly ran away.
2251: her handkerchief has fallen too;
2252: her hands affectionately pressed;
2253: her head in modesty cast down,
2254: her heart had long been overrun:
2255: her heart had spoken, free as air,
2256: her heart speaks to her even louder
2257: her heartache, did it long compel her,
2258: Her husband enters, thus concluding
2259: her husband's or the world's attention...
2260: her journey home is overdue.
2261: her kindness, move Tatyana; yet
2262: her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
2263: her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
2264: her love obeys the laws of feeling,
2265: Her loving spouse with approbation
2266: her manner is no less contained;
2267: her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
2268: her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
2269: her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
2270: Her passion burns with stronger powder
2271: her path a hare in headlong flight
2272: her progress at the masquerade.
2273: her Russian was as thin as vapour,
2274: her sacred store of bliss and weeping
2275: her seal with its engraven crest.
2276: her secret work of magic suasion!
2277: her soul was waiting... for someone.
2278: her soul's attention; just behind her
2279: her steppeland charms into a rout.3
2280: Her tender touch had never fingered
2281: her thoughts away, knew how to lavish
2282: her to the altar and the crown.
2283: her way; she passed, then as she walked
2284: her worth (but anathematising
2285: her youth with all his repertoire

2291: here there's no conscience, here no sense;
2292: Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
2293: here's boredom, madness or pretence,
2294: here's Petushkóv, the local fop;
2295: here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
2296: Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,

2330: his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
2331: his hours to dreaming them away:

2408: How often, with her sweet communion,
2409: how pleasantly the stages pass.
2410: how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
2411: how sad the scar of passion's knife:
2412: how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!

2414: how soon the bounds of rank and station
2415: how they remind me of your stem,
2416: how to engage in talk that drew

2447: I don't know why, but for my friend
2448: I don't mean that she never shivered,
2449: I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
2450: I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
2451: I feel a brotherly affection,
2452: I feel a small foot in my hand;
2453: I find myself no longer equal;
2454: I find no sense; the truth is this,
2455: I gave my word, alas, though now
2456: I gave no rein to sweet affection:

2485: I might have seen you, heard you speak
2486: I move in the grand monde? that rank,
2487: I must translate -- there's no presuming --
2488: I must wake up with the conviction

4105: So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
4106: so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,

4218: sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,

4222: swiftly decayed beyond recall

4265: Tatyana shared with full conviction
4266: Tatyana simply lay in bed,
4267: Tatyana struggles to run out --

4295: Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
4296: thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
4297: thank you for suffering and its joys,
4298: thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
4299: that  in  losing  its  rhyme   the  work  loses  its  ``bloom''  he  argues,

4301: that all of Russia can't contribute
4302: that ardent youth entirely lacks;

4318: That isn't our immediate worry:
4319: that king of the satiric scene,
4320: that lady the hostess was greeting,
4321: that lady whose engaging charm
4322: that languid beauty, listens nicely --
4323: that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
4324: that lives, and glitters, and endears,
4325: that marble Nina's proved unable

4329: that moment, of a luscious pie
4330: that night, in secret, set for two;

4353: that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
4354: that thievish mouths cannot consume
4355: that this of all things for a swain

4367: that youthful heart. ``But now at least
4368: that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
4369: that's the morass, I beg you note,
4370: that's the refrain that you should sing,
4371: That's when I'll sit down to compose
4372: that's where my years of youth were spent.
4373: that, artless, and without concealing,
4374: that, for all this, my shame's report

4381: the allée to the lake, the copse;
4382: the altar flame's extinguished now.
4383: the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
4384: the answer's past all human viewing,
4385: The arbitrary rules of passion
4386: the ardent author of the past
4387: the art he'd studied best of all,
4388: the atmosphere of youth and madness,
4389: the audience still is busy stamping,
4390: The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
4391: the ballroom drove me off my head:
4392: the bank, the immobile stream are levelled

4396: the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
4397: the bear has raised her in his paws;

4405: the blaze of candles, and the trembly
4406: the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
4407: the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
4408: the blood came smoking from the wound.
4409: the blood within my withered heart,
4410: the bloom has withered on the bough;
4411: The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
4412: the books then underwent inspection...
4413: the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
4414: the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
4415: the branches all are weighted down
4416: the branches of the oak with flock;
4417: the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
4418: The brio of the Russian text partly depends on a lavish use not only of
4419: the cabinet behind the door
4420: the carriage of the newly-wed.
4421: The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
4422: The château was of a construction

4432: the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
4433: The clock of doom had struck as fated;
4434: the coach has reached its destination;
4435: the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
4436: the cold perfection of the sky,

4438: the condition that it  shall not,  by way of trade or  otherwise,  be  lent,
4439: the cooks prepare the midday meal;
4440: the coolness of the sombre glade,
4441: the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
4442: the country cottages and hovels,

4449: The darkness thins away; but still
4450: the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
4451: the darling sex is light as down.
4452: The days flew past; by now the season
4453: the days grew shorter, in the glade
4454: the days that doom has measured out.
4455: the deeper in the wood, the more
4456: the doorway opened wide to meet her,
4457: the downy woods are greener-tinted;
4458: the draught whose blessings are agreed,
4459: the driver sits and cuts a dash
4460: the eager players are enrolled --
4461: the earlier griefs are what I miss.
4462: the early pealing of the bells
4463: the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
4464: the easier they become to charm,
4465: the elegy, grown paralytic,
4466: the English  translator's failure to convey anything more than -- at best --
4467: the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
4468: the entire story of your fate.
4469: The evening passes, and meanwhile
4470: the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
4471: the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
4472: the faces met with everywhere;
4473: the fateful diet; by depression
4474: the fear and rage with which I foam!
4475: the festal name day has begun.
4476: The fields are dark, since evening came.
4477: The fire was dying; cinders faintly
4478: the first will never find fruition,
4479: the flaming roses of a cheek,
4480: the fleeting tenderness that stole
4481: the fleeting works of my creation,
4482: the flickering tones of dress and speech,
4483: The flirt has reason's cool volition;
4484: the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
4485: the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
4486: the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
4487: the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
4488: the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
4489: the foreign words a maiden's passion
4490: the friends' salute she never hears
4491: the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
4492: the full fruit of her heart's desire;

4818: There's vacancies in plenty there.''
4819: there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
4820: there, where the coulisse entrance went,
4821: There, with epigrammatic neatness,
4822: These days I'm finding even gladness,
4823: These figures from the world of seeming,
4824: these words are not of Russian stock:
4825: they all have richly earned a pension;''
4826: they all have swarmed into the hall,
4827: they all still keep their old impress:

4842: they rise and ripen and fall dead:
4843: they shared their days in deed and heart,
4844: They should be forced to read in Russian,
4845: they shove each plate, and every chair,
4846: They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
4847: they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
4848: They take her too to the Assembly.
4849: they talk of her, of how and whether:
4850: they took offence at this, and broke
4851: they were her only food... and so
4852: they while away the morning's calm.

4863: thinking: he loved me, and in strife
4864: thirty-two steps with great precision,
4865: this angel, this proud devil, tell,
4866: this child of luxury and delight.
4867: This dear, still world I must forswear
4868: this denizen of the coulisses

4871: this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
4872: This translation first published 1977
4873: this very day I'd gladly give,

4877: This work of the profoundest learning
4878: This world's so vacuous that it's got
4879: Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
4880: those monkeys of the good old days:

4882: those words where love, without condition,

4897: thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
4898: threats, vows, and simulated fears,

4904: Thronged by adorers, I've detected
4905: through baseness of the soul that he,
4906: through distant regions of the heart...
4907: through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
4908: through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
4909: through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
4910: through it they're known to me, and kin.
4911: through the back porch runs out and flies
4912: Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
4913: throughout the boredom of the hours --
4914: Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,

4916: thumps as the balls are pressed inside
4917: till he at last was summoned down
4918: till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
4919: till now our language -- proud, God knows --
4920: till then had been dispersed and wasted --
4921: Time races, and she's been forgetting

4923: Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
4924: time was, in evening hours of leisure,
4925: times were when I was sharp and bold:
4926: times were, when master's least suggestion...''

5508: with me to see an alien strand;
5509: With mounts from home, or postal station,
5510: with mournful sound the secret shade
5511: with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
5512: with old Anisia. The next day
5513: with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
5514: with our Mamas, and a sensation
5515: with our poor girl was kind and good;
5516: with parks and mansions, open up.
5517: with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
5518: with perturbation and with worry;
5519: with pleasure on his vengeful act.
5520: with pots and basins out of mind,
5521: with puzzled and confused regard...
5522: With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
5523: with recent fortune, vainly waited
5524: with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
5525: with scorn to make my world a hell.
5526: with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
5527: with shelves of books deployed for action,
5528: with sighs unconsciously regretful.
5529: With spelling scrambled to perdition,
5530: with spinning noise and senseless flashing
5531: with storm and tumult in his head,
5532: with such a blissful, brief infection --
5533: with tears, in quarters of the maids:
5534: with tenderness he'd watched and noted
5535: With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
5536: with the grand general in her wake --
5537: with the pink glow the snows assume
5538: with the resounding chime of glass.
5539: with the unmistakeable sideview
5540: with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
5541: with this the hero of my tale:
5542: with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
5543: with three roan horses in a line
5544: with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
5545: with trees decked in their silvery kit,
5546: with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
5547: with visions of enchanted night,
5548: with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
5549: with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
5550: With womankind, the less we love them,
5551: with work at home; but when he'd gone,
5552: with years no more to meet our gaze?
5553: with young Semyónova,9 and there
5554: with your good offices, and so
5555: within her bosom to abate,
5556: without a goal on which to fix,
5557: without a trace of spite or plot,
5558: without a word Tatyana leant
5559: without an elegiac frill,
5560: without preliminary feeler
5561: Without romance, or false insistence,
5562: without surprise or rage... his laden,
5563: won't benefit these guts of mine.''
5564: won't even cross their minds by stealth...
5565: word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
5566: words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
5567: work.
5568: works where contemporary man
5569: world-weary  or romantic, the sparkle  of  his jokes,  the  flavour  of  his
5570: Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
5571: worthier of you in the perfection
5572: would be allied to him by fate;
5573: would bless the form his fortune took.
5574: would cause widespread remark and tattle,
5575: would fill Tatyana from afar
5576: would have been all that we required!
5577: would have been spared this laceration.
5578: would have divined the tender, shrinking
5579: would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
5580: would launch into self-sacrifice;
5581: would leave her dithering and tossing.
5582: would not have recognized again
5583: would on those evenings guess the fate
5584: would say goodbye and drive away,
5585: would settle, on the morrow morning,
5586: would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
5587: wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
5588: wronged always in disgraceful fashion --

5871: yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
5872: yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
5873: Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
5874: yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
5875: Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
5876: Yet -- fear itself she found presented
5877: yet a capricious inclination,
5878: yet dared not trust what I could see.
5879: yet floods of talk around the town...
5880: yet he fell out of love at last
5881: yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
5882: Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
5883: yet how I wish that I might raise
5884: Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
5885: yet people's malice and suspicion
5886: Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
5887: Yet Tanya's note made its impression
5888: Yet the mazurka keeps today
5889: yet, as each rule has its exception,
5890: yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
5891: you acted well, that dread occasion,
5892: you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
5893: you called there twice, and since then took
5894: you drink the magic draught of yearning,
5895: you find the country godforsaken;
5896: you gave me such a shocking fright!
5897: you help him to an honoured fate
5898: You husbands, deeply I respect you!
5899: you in my arms on gingerbread?''
5900: you kept your friendship with our friend:
5901: you know I'm hard to comprehend...
5902: you learn life's sweetness, and with this
5903: you left no steps that could be tracked:
5904: you loved the opulent contact
5905: you made me drunk as one could ask!
5906: you newborn work, and like a winner
5907: you object of my guileless ditties!
5908: you see the two in uniform...
5909: you see your fated tempter stand.
5910: you see, with tears and incantation
5911: you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
5912: you too have seen on Neva's brink.
5913: You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
5914: You too, prime beauties in your flower
5915: you took an honourable part --
5916: you were the first ones he forswore;
5917: you won't find that quite so much catch...
5918: you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
5919: You'd never class her as a beauty;
5920: you'd not so much as know the name,
5921: You'll love again, but you must teach
5922: you'll never leave me to my fate.
5923: you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
5924: you'll recognize him soon enough, --
5925: you're all in fever... heavens above.''
5926: you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
5927: you're sure to find her portrait in it:
5928: You've guessed before it all began:
5929: you've made so many secret rhymes,
5930: you've paid insanity its due.
5931: Young ladies jump for future blisses...
5932: young poet, be for ever blest!''
5933: young Tanya first appeared to me,
5934: young traitresses by the platoon,
5935: your advent swamps me in its flood!
5936: your battles, lawless and atrocious,
5937: your chorus, is it dead for ever?
5938: your cold discourse, were less unkind --
5939: Your curiosity is burning
5940: your dashing one, is she surviving?''
5941: your early life, unlock your tongue:
5942: your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
5943: your grief would fail to touch my heart,
5944: your heart some self-restraint; for each
5945: your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
5946: your heroes, raging and ferocious,
5947: Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
5948: your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
5949: your loved one, honourable reader!
5950: your matchlessness, to seek to capture
5951: your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
5952: your night of fretting's left no trace!
5953: your presence aches, and in my blood!
5954: your pride, some answer, or in truth
5955: your soul displays, in holy dreams,
5956: your Tanya's image in your mind,
5957: your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
5958: your words, and in my soul to explore
5959: your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
5960: yourself too long from social life.''
5961: youth is a fever; we must spare
5962: youth which has nothing to regret,
5963: youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
5964: youthful, who ripened in his time,
5965: Zarétsky, sometime king of brawls
5966: Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
5967: Zaretsky draws up a convention
5968: Zaretsky rose without discussion;
5969: Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
5970: Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
5971: Zhukovsky

503: raised a dull eye to moon's refulgence,
504: now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
505: An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
506: here's boredom, madness or pretence,
507: Without romance, or false insistence,
508: as helpmeet in my sad existence,
509: From his first youth he'd known the force,
510: for him a lofty stair. His shade,
511: just now of wrestling with his shade,
512: the coolness of the sombre glade,
513: < amongst the soulless men of pride,
514: she sits down calmly on one side,
515: the new moon, horned, on her left side,
516: Friend of my heart, be at my side,
517: perfidious blow to my inside,
518: And now the door is opened wide,
519: now sensitive, and now carefree,
520: each springtime, on the growing tree,
521: Onegin too -- and there to see,
522: at first, with God knows whom to see,
523: Now here's a letter, as you see,
524: the peaceful Muses' devotee,
525: the climacteric of our life,
526: always contented with his life,
527: where civil treacheries are rife,
528: the lies that in the press run rife,
529: his children and his faithful wife,
530: and with no post, no work, no wife,
531: are bound, by every virtuous wife,
532: has found a port for his old age,
533: good-looking, in the flower of age,
534: all this, at eighteen years of age,
535: that nubile maid of riper age,
536: are entered here, in friendship's gage,
537: mountains are piled on every carriage,
538: the solitude of woods and tillage,
539: He's gone away and left his village,
540: and lives, a veritable sage,
541: as was the old suspicious sage,
542: of their society turned her savage,
543: where he was master of his college,
544: through baseness of the soul that he,
545: Was it to no effect that he,
546: took her to his estate, where she,
547: death on his brow, your friend should lie,
548: Five versts or so from Krasnogórie,
549: that soul without a moral tie,
550: a rambling walk beside my lake,
551: on tragedy; but it's no joke,
552: just at this crisis of his gale,
553: in question, gossip, news and tale,
554: the leather rein, to learn the tale,
555: value the hero of my tale,
556: But from the hero of my tale,
557: in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
558: ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
559: a skeleton jerked by a cable,
560: Prepared for prophecy and fable,
561: a grammar, a digest of fable,
562: to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,
563: two cupboards, one divan, a table,
564: a group of monsters round a table,
565: the iron figure3 on the table,
566: Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
567: cooked-up where garret-vermin babble,
568: endorsed by fashionable rabble,
569: When out to burst a rival's bubble,
570: or cause the bursting of his bubble,
571: How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
572: of sunlight makes it flash and crumble,
573: Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
574: Then in return for all this twaddle,
575: a steed responsive to the bridle,
576: Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
577: bored by success' giddy trifle,
578: not even by chance, once in a while,
579: he even dares, once in a while,
580: will the benighted reason smile,
581: emboldened by his Olga's smile,
582: his virulence that made you smile,
583: scarce out of bibs, already fickle,
584: fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,
585: The hall is full of noise and hustle,
586: for dreams, or journalistic battle,

592: unnoticed, in unseeing style,
593: young Tanya first appeared to me,
594: He destined Olga's hand for me,
595: I've no one here who comprehends me,
596: and now a swooning mind attends me,
597: an old man saw her as she came,
598: that there be just one voice which came,
599: become a joke to us, its game,
600: you'd not so much as know the name,
601: though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
602: while men, all sombre, all the same,
603: the hapless Phrygians all the same,
604: freezes my blood... Yet all the same,

606: felicitously every theme,
607: summits of aspen, birch and lime,
608: no beauties of a foreign clime,
609: she won't inhale the powdered rime,
610: the horror of disgrace and crime,
611: Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
612: youthful, who ripened in his time,
613: where are the reveries this time,

623: and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
624: of whispering woods where my Eugene,
625: moved and surprised, she stays serene,
626: left her to follow her own line,
627: Tatyana, lonely heroine,
628: in secret judgement what he'd done,
629: with work at home; but when he'd gone,

635: I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
636: her darling foot of its wet shoe,
637: From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
638: right in the flower of joyous hope,
639: Just let yourself be your whole care,
640: and Grandison beyond compare,
641: Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
642: closely embraced, in wending here,
643: beneath the stone reposes here,
644: her drops of tears, and seated there,
645: and where's her sister now? and where,

650: to hear what latest modes require,
651: their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
652: From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
653: by moonlight two young girls took pleasure,
654: thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
655: But in misfortune or displeasure,
656: And then, to part us in full measure,
657: the secret of her husband's measure,
658: so it was not in any measure,
659: Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
660: O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
661: time was, in evening hours of leisure,
662: she found, in labours and in leisure,
663: it touched with reverie her leisure,
664: she calls down curses on their leisure,
665: that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
666: And so, at last, feature by feature,
667: the hall's without a living creature,
668: it's also true, in battle's rapture,
669: some vote a doctor for the case,
670: his pistols, laid them in their case,
671: then afterwards, alone, at ease,
672: her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
673: with heart that's grown unused to praise,
674: gentlemanly, quite precise,
675: have vanished, like an empty noise,
676: smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
677: or, with an epigram-surprise,

679: prepares himself; and then his verse,
680: of oligarchical converse,
681: compact of amorous trash, and worse,
682: so, cursing women's devious course,

686: in loaded carriages, migrate,
687: to fashion's absolute dictate,
688: of pity for my wretched state,
689: He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
690: of plains where boredom reigns complete,
691: here a weak version, incomplete,
692: the murmuring Nereids recite,
693: roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
694: a patriot, a cosmopolite,
695: proficiency to speak and write,
696: a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,
697: that's the morass, I beg you note,
698: still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
699: yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
700: and set on hating the coquette,
701: stood in the door, cherubic, mute,
702: on billiard-table rests a cue,
703: already studying to intrigue,
704: unhesitating from her tongue,
705: to cool my glances and my tongue,
706: of a provincial ingénue,
707: am always glad to write, it's true,
708: ourselves on our landfall. It's true,
709: this very day I'd gladly give,
710: the glare, the fumes in which I live,
711: Such feckless passion -- as I live,
712: whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
713: not cold, but also not effusive,
714: she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
715: he found Tatyana so attractive,
716: what can one do? as said above,
717: vexation? vainness? heavens above,
718: frightened to death a timid love,
719: recalling earlier loves, did we,
720: to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
721: homestead, before her parents' gaze,
722: arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
723: looks at him with a steady gaze,
724: we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
725: her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
726: and all into the salon squeeze,
727: each moral puts us in a doze,
728: The ploughman there delights to doze,
729: she once had pined in girlish grief,
730: yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
731: at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
732: and took two Petriads in calf,
733: he charged three roubles and a half,
734: he never took one from the shelf,
735: odd volumes from the devil's shelf,
736: is forced to crucify himself,
737: a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
738: the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
739: How heavy, and how near to sobbing,
740: to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
741: What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
742: the barbs that envy's always spreading,
743: what's in them? All this loud parading,
744: and all this flashy masquerading,
745: that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
746: he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
747: he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
748: They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
749: On the seashore, with storm impending,
750: ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
751: has voices that are more resounding,

753: the utter virtue of their being,
754: in the expression of its being,
755: but piteous he, the all-foreseeing,
756: a word or two, or stare unseeing,
757: In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
758: she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
759: and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
760: its echoes, its belated urging,
761: its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
762: to whom, in a fine flow of preaching,
763: he had conveyed some moral teaching,
764: our troikas effortlessly dashing,
765: Then our Automedons are flashing,
766: Below it, when sprang rains are swishing,
767: but wildly still her heart is rushing,
768: Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,

773: over the business of leave-taking,
774: Next day Tatyana, early waking,
775: ``oh, quit your stale, your tedious quacking,

780: The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
781: fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
782: as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
783: Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
784: her love obeys the laws of feeling,
785: allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
786: hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,
787: Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
788: just sentries to each other calling,

790: the  psychological  insight,  the  devious  narrative  skill, the thrilling,

796: lickspittles who adore their crawling,
797: stirred at your gaze, so strange, so gleaming,
798: one customary object gleaming,
799: how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
800: embodied by the power of dreaming,
801: perpetually, one goal for dreaming,
802: and everything around was dreaming,

807: the regimental band is coming,
808: as all things did, to bore him; homing,
809: He could have spoken without harming,
810: when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
811: and, on my bed-head gently leaning,
812: with love and comfort in your meaning,
813: my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
814: ``The morning star will soon be shining,
815: I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
816: and so, before the world of learning,
817: devoted to the Muse, or learning,

819: you drink the magic draught of yearning,
820: and where is love's tempestuous yearning,

836: There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,

855: So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
856: no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
857: in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
858: Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
859: they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
860: The years incline to gloom and prosing,
861: new guest is gradually progressing,
862: admires the tumult and the pressing,
863: I longed, like every breaker hissing,
864: ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,

869: She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
870: Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
871: in you a tender pulse was beating,
872: we'll keep love's price appreciating,
873: The house is packed out; scintillating,
874: reader, we must be separating,
875: and thus our race, so fluctuating,
876: light as a shadow, shuns a meeting,
877: ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,

882: Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
883: untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
884: Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
885: he who has cooled down love with parting,
886: the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
887: the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
888: That point I wouldn't mind contesting,

894: while serious topics were disputing,
895: Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,

902: Day faded; on the table, glowing,
903: How often, when the sky was glowing,
904: once, with its foaming and its playing,
905: No one will think that worth gainsaying,
906: Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
907: So went his sermon. Almost dying,
908: And yet, although it's past conveying,
909: By now the shades of night are flying,

911: through heaven's expanse serenely flying,

914: secluded vales, where swans were crying,
915: The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
916: Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,
917: to talk as if with heart unwrung,
918: so sketchily possessed by each,
919: in my petition an approach,
920: his humbly suppliant approach,
921: the flickering tones of dress and speech,
922: is it not true that Russian speech,
923: now pay attention, I beseech,

926: with foppery and too much starch,
927: a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
928: no vulgar epigram too much,
929: there's no absurdity as such,

933: with deep emotion through and through,
934: so pure, so spotless through and through,

938: the meaning of an epigraph,
939: Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
940: there's nothing can employ her anguish,
941: Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
942: Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
943: suddenly lowering eyes that languish,
944: of waiting for the dawn to blush,
945: fieldwork directed from the path,
946: an eloquence of fevered strength,
947: fragments of poems from the North,
948: fancies, my rhythmic search for truth,
949: In stead of happiness, say I,
950: verdicts of vanity the bleak,
951: but all concurred that, truth to speak,
952: none listens when the others speak,
953: is agony, if I may speak,
954: men's thoughts, their plots, the words they speak,
955: to pass for an affected freak,
956: the other, jugs of applejack,
957: avert his chest from pistol's click,
958: but when past joking he fell sick,
959: Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
960: but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
961: grow cold, and hard, and stiff as stock,
962: By dire presentiment awestruck,
963: the flaming roses of a cheek,
964: behind the mill. In solemn talk,
965: I move in the grand monde? that rank,
966: their guests, for all they ate and drank,
967: where you were born as well, I think,
968: Ladies of such a cast, I think,
969: at hours, which, why I cannot think,

971: So now be off to Neva's brink,
972: parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,
973: the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
974: he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
975: terse words or crosses in the book,
976: in father's or old uncle's book,
977: with lively and pellucid look,
978: sad meditations in her look,
979: And just here, in the window-nook,
980: where flows a little glittering brook,
981: then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
982: coldness of wit; each note he took,
983: for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
984: blessed are daytime's care and cark,
985: Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
986: a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
987: with draughts from love's enticing flask,
988: over the modish word ideal,
989: goodbye to you, my true ideal,
990: the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
991: a novel, vague and superficial,
992: over his neighbour's plain memorial,
993: But let's return to our essential,
994: his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
995: But he could draw a joking moral,
996: so heartless and so detrimental,
997: she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
998: and the majestic, antlered royal,
999: while floors would split from crash of heel,
1000: or cunningly create a quarrel,
1001: Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
1002: No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
1003: Now, faced with this enormous revel,
1004: dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
1005: lift up the gauzes of her veil,
1006: wishes his madness to the devil,
1007: installed in me a different devil,
1008: the art he'd studied best of all,
1009: ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
1010: we'd better hasten to the ball,

1018: although it's nearly heard the knell,
1019: my friends, I need to pause a spell,
1020: beauty with all its heavenly spell,
1021: this angel, this proud devil, tell,
1022: and breeding ducks and geese as well,
1023: spectacled age divines as well,
1024: Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,
1025: Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
1026: without an elegiac frill,
1027: such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
1028: Often she halts against her will,
1029: is he who's never felt its will,
1030: the world's éclat, its thunder-roll,
1031: Public opinion -- here's our idol,
1032: graduates of the Levshin1 school,
1033: past all the assembly in a whirl,
1034: Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
1035: for them, in Butterweek5 the greaseful,
1036: The years would pass; no longer youthful,
1037: Perhaps however, to be truthful,
1038: wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
1039: a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
1040: Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
1041: he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
1042: Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
1043: oppressed by emptiness of soul,
1044: left quite alone with his own soul,
1045: he's first to toast her in the bowl,
1046: impatiently on the mill-dam,
1047: some other, older spring will gleam,
1048: in midst of a poetic dream,
1049: freedom's enthusiastic dream,
1050: another, a more chilling dream,
1051: the magic voices of your stream,
1052: retired, as he, from fashion's stream,
1053: dean of Chaldea's learned team,
1054: from German realms of mist and steam,
1055: some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
1056: hereditary foes they seem,
1057: Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
1058: With womankind, the less we love them,
1059: a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
1060: It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
1061: how they remind me of your stem,
1062: Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
1063: at length, midst children swarming round him,
1064: At home she'll equably receive him,
1065: But she refuses to perceive him,
1066: dared clean his nails in front of him,
1067: he's a freemason too; for him,
1068: cherries then we'll throw at him,
1069: a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
1070: a nightingale, in forest gloom,
1071: across the plain's enormous room,
1072: the easier they become to charm,
1073: ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
1074: Semyón Petróvich, mean and glum,
1075: epoch's portrayed, survived the ban,
1076: They should be forced to read in Russian,
1077: So a disabled soldier-man,
1078: for her improvement, a roman,
1079: The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
1080: without surprise or rage... his laden,
1081: and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
1082: her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
1083: Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,
1084: Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
1085: the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
1086: she sees it all. The simple maiden,
1087: return an answer, blunt or keen,
1088: use cunning silence as a screen,
1089: so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
1090: and once forbidden fruit is seen,
1091: In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
1092: immortals picked by fate for when,
1093: ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,
1094: A sledded coach, for years forsaken,
1095: the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
1096: of human friendship, holy men,
1097: and with a yawn took up his pen,
1098: by Baratynsky's3 wondrous pen,
1099: Martin Zadéka was the siren,
1100: In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
1101: And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,
1102: to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
1103: are here untouched by fashion's reign,
1104: drives home -- and plunging deeper in,
1105: on liquor, and on hay brought in,
1106: When we draw a fellow in,
1107: was one who raged and raged again,
1108: after two minutes, off again,
1109: advantages of heart and brain,
1110: plunged in reflection's deepest train,
1111: a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
1112: something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
1113: days that are lost behind the curtain,
1114: No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
1115: for, mistress-like, it's brilliant, vain,
1116: Oh, this could all be false and vain,
1117: He deemed, in general, letters vain,
1118: a deathless murmur from within,
1119: on kennels, and on kith and kin,
1120: surer than friendship or than kin,
1121: Prince P. Vyazemsky (1791--1878), poet, critic and close friend of  Pushkin,
1122: ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
1123: Buyánov, my vivacious cousin,
1124: since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
1125: he saw no point in staying on,
1126: the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
1127: invariably, as time went on,
1128: In duels a pedantic don,
1129: on a fast stallion from the Don,
1130: I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
1131: they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
1132: no softball for the winds of fashion,
1133: But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
1134: amid the deadening joys of fashion,
1135: All this has now gone out of fashion,
1136: sharing her in promiscuous fashion,
1137: Already, in exultant fashion,
1138: of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
1139: How often, with her sweet communion,
1140: Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
1141: you acted well, that dread occasion,
1142: He reads to Olga on occasion,
1143: of moralistical persuasion,
1144: your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
1145: How dull are acting and evasion,
1146: thirty-two steps with great precision,
1147: which has recalled, without precision,
1148: Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
1149: which, listening with some condescension,
1150: He got so used to this immersion,
1151: He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
1152: facing a belle I loved with passion,
1153: But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
1154: he's viewed the boxes without passion,
1155: to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
1156: Well, I must make a frank confession,
1157: As, lovingly, in his confession,
1158: I make magnanimous confession,
1159: At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
1160: Bard13 of The Feasts, and heart's depression,
1161: Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
1162: in Russian never found expression,
1163: before such candour of expression,
1164: the poet's heart found full expression,
1165: On these, with something like obsession,
1166: Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
1167: A thinker in a desert mission,
1168: pours out its guiltless frank admission,
1169: her discomposure, her confusion,
1170: and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
1171: an idle monk in glum seclusion,
1172: The manor house, in deep seclusion,
1173: What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
1174: He followed them without illusion,
1175: screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
1176: lost them without regret's contusion,
1177: at verse, and hiss an imprecation,
1178: Idle again by dedication,
1179: of Eugene, cold as all creation,
1180: the fleeting works of my creation,
1181: Evgeny, hating litigation,
1182: in indescribable elation,
1183: of philosophic isolation,
1184: so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
1185: alone, and sunk in calculation,
1186: Compassion, yes, and indignation,
1187: secure a secret assignation,
1188: and all our fresh imagination,
1189: I'll gladden your imagination,
1190: come, trouble my imagination,
1191: yet a capricious inclination,
1192: too long, against my inclination,
1193: then he'd implore a declaration,
1194: Bards of our tearful generation,
1195: by writers of her admiration,
1196: when our sublimest aspiration,
1197: where dwelt this child of inspiration,
1198: Fired by the god of inspiration,
1199: ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
1200: hear, once more filled with inspiration,
1201: field-work, and walks with inspiration,
1202: But come, thou youthful inspiration,
1203: bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
1204: Though belles had lost his adoration,
1205: with a blunt cue for the duration,
1206: it had no sparkle of sensation,
1207: Then gradually upon sensation,
1208: (I like a friendly conversation,
1209: no mannerism, no affectation,
1210: the strangeness of her habitation,
1211: trusted her without hesitation,
1212: where fate had fixed our confrontation,
1213: Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
1214: before the window taking station,
1215: With mounts from home, or postal station,
1216: is where old master took up station,
1217: The invalid's glad salutation,
1218: on words of foreign derivation,
1219: I pray God grant his soul salvation,
1220: what kind of thought, what observation,
1221: I thank him without reservation,
1222: with shelves of books deployed for action,
1223: The nervous-tragical reaction,
1224: by what's called machinal reaction,
1225: A pause of silence and inaction,
1226: He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
1227: Lensky all evening, in distraction,
1228: I grasp a stirrup with affection,
1229: I feel a brotherly affection,
1230: on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
1231: for him all sham has found rejection,
1232: I've drawn a plan and a projection,
1233: the man of reverie and reflection,
1234: what holds her in profound reflection,
1235: in simple but sublime reflection,
1236: almanacs, journals of reflection,
1237: Lending his tone a grave inflection,
1238: what held me was my predilection,
1239: He found them in some old collection,
1240: then on the leaves of recollection,
1241: you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
1242: he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
1243: Poets, I'll say in this connection,
1244: but looks and talk took the direction,
1245: I trust my fate to your direction,
1246: Reader, whatever fate's direction,
1247: to undertake their resurrection,
1248: giving the lady their protection,
1249: there's far too much of contradiction,
1250: drink in the midnight benediction,
1251: in dreams and cards and their prediction,
1252: untouched by trace of inhibition,
1253: I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
1254: a joker in the old tradition,
1255: the guardian angel of tradition,
1256: a modish second-hand edition,
1257: the modesty of her condition,
1258: Tatyana, hiding her condition,
1259: Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
1260: those words where love, without condition,
1261: At this midnight of my condition,
1262: With spelling scrambled to perdition,
1263: His unexpected apparition,
1264: what is he? Just an apparition,
1265: was it not you, dear apparition,
1266: methodical by disposition,
1267: the first will never find fruition,
1268: at first Madame gave him tuition,
1269: and then it's tea that comes to mention,
1270: it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
1271: She's paid the sunrise no attention,
1272: Now, she devours, with what attention,
1273: devoured a book with rapt attention,
1274: he'll charm you with his fine invention,
1275: Deaf to her sister's intervention,
1276: She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
1277: your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
1278: What sort of roses, in your notion,
1279: Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
1280: By dreams now sad in their conception,
1281: yet, as each rule has its exception,
1282: he almost begs for absolution,
1283: he looks, in sweet irresolution,
1284: that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
1285: a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
1286: young traitresses by the platoon,
1287: by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
1288: Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
1289: Each day, despite the appeals of reason,
1290: imagination, with such reason,
1291: Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
1292: so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
1293: He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
1294: no meaning in or out of season,
1295: By contrast, in the frozen season,
1296: a free romance's far horizon,
1297: my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
1298: something to fritter and to burn,
1299: products of carefree hours, of fun,
1300: for friends of languor, or of fun,
1301: last night he'd erred in making fun,
1302: one sees a duck and aims his gun,
1303: and soon his travels had begun,
1304: and paler than the moon at dawn,
1305: for Olga, on the spreading lawn,
1306: her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
1307: onset of the incipient yawn,
1308: her head in modesty cast down,
1309: and lovelorn maiden whom he'd known,
1310: and at the altar, with a crown,
1311: the shepherd, as he used to do,
1312: still meek, still deaf as howd'youdo,
1313: where did that glum eccentric go,
1314: as fast as post-horses could go,
1315: ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
1316: glitter and tumble as they go,
1317: a soul that perished long ago,
1318: of language which, so long ago,
1319: in Lycée gardens long ago,
1320: or pine, persuade of yes or no,
1321: and how's Tatyana? Olga too,
1322: Onegin sits at table too,
1323: so pious, and so clever too,
1324: can chatter, and be silent too,
1325: punctilious in his cotton cap,
1326: and introduced, for the last lap,
1327: the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
1328: mountains will part; below the deep,
1329: Only Tatyana does not sleep,
1330: across each bush, across each steep,
1331: land where I learned to love and weep,
1332: henceforth in front of you I weep,
1333: taken the saucers in their grip,
1334: song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
1335: a plain, unceremonious troop,
1336: from thirty down to two; and stop,
1337: he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
1338: recall, by its bewitching cup,
1339: the joys of youth, that festal cup,
1340: their hand to grapple slander's cup,
1341: neighbours and friends in kindly group,
1342: Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
1343: sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
1344: unseen, already you were dear,
1345: Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
1346: by waters that were still and clear,
1347: my soul had heard your voice ring clear,
1348: as gay as morning and as clear,
1349: an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
1350: villages flickered far and near,
1351: when we see him from afar,
1352: complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
1353: ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
1354: Whether the arrow has my number,
1355: Back to his regiment the Lancer,
1356: Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,
1357: in my long task, be my upholder,
1358: in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
1359: Who taught her an address so tender,
1360: My love for it is just as tender,
1361: that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
1362: the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
1363: ladies at the fireside confer,
1364: who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
1365: roamed the still forest like a ranger,
1366: by fate's decree: this freakish stranger,
1367: then know that your reproving finger,
1368: in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
1369: ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
1370: what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
1371: ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
1372: But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
1373: bound where the magic bow will send her,
1374: her heartache, did it long compel her,
1375: To my astonishment I've seen her,
1376: all day, all night, his presence fills her,
1377: Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
1378: the doorway opened wide to meet her,
1379: At once Anisia came to greet her,
1380: I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
1381: hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
1382: a joking flirt, or both together,
1383: And not because she'd read him, either,
1384: I would have found a friend, another,
1385: for God's sake, that will do. But, brother,
1386: long since, like brother linked to brother,
1387: and more than once the German baker,
1388: and health, life's sweetness and its shimmer,
1389: who in the country spends her summer,
1390: and the young city-bred newcomer,
1391: He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
1392: Gvozdín, exemplary farmer,
1393: Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
1394: but just to make the bargain keener,
1395: exercised, under lucre's banner,
1396: In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
1397: into the mud, a drunken goner,
1398: unswerving friend, correct landowner,
1399: Give me a pen and give me paper,
1400: she never read a Russian paper,
1401: of secrets, like a friend but dearer,
1402: was Göttingen, his alma mater,
1403: of Neva's proud imperial water,
1404: I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
1405: What do I want? what am I after,
1406: Evgeny, full of inward laughter,
1407: like a drunk traveller in a shelter,
1408: between two aunts, in pillared shelter,
1409: panes patterned by the finest printer,
1410: pale transcript of a vivid master,
1411: Longtime inside this modish cloister,
1412: It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
1413: there was a general furtive chatter,
1414: No, incorrect and careless chatter,
1415: The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
1416: Their talk, so sound on every matter,
1417: evoke emotion's pitter-patter,
1418: Who could have looked the poet better,
1419: but brighter than the heavenly litter,
1420: The night has many stars that glitter,
1421: she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
1422: Fare thee well, and if for ever,
1423: Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
1424: so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
1425: that fell, and then began to shiver,
1426: led to the princess, all a-shiver,
1427: And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
1428: not once a day a thought will quiver,
1429: Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,
1430: There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
1431: with brilliant conquests by the shower,
1432: his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
1433: not separation's chilling power,
1434: Lensky at home awaits the answer,
1435: he's at the club, a real stayer,
1436: her heart had spoken, free as air,
1437: the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
1438: a deft arrangement to his hair,
1439: they shove each plate, and every chair,
1440: no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
1441: but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,
1442: To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
1443: Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,
1444: or, after some dull dinner's labour,
1445: Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
1446: Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
1447: ``Let's go.'' The friends, all haste and vigour,
1448: whispers some ballad of the hour,
1449: my inept pupil, at that hour,
1450: Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
1451: he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
1452: like Regulus, that god of honour,
1453: her Russian was as thin as vapour,
1454: of the dull shores of my disfavour,
1455: to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
1456: in sledded coaches and coupés,
1457: insists, when the mazurka ends,
1458: dear companions, darling friends,
1459: on most occasions between friends,
1460: I prize the attention of my friends,
1461: and by Repentance. All this lends,
1462: the total ownership of woods,
1463: a fop, a punter on the cards,
1464: although there are no streets, no cards,
1465: Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
1466: to all the most adored actrices,
1467: with bended knees a windmill dances,
1468: From early on she loved romances,
1469: recalling earlier time's romances,
1470: till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
1471: the prejudices of the ages,
1472: (vain twaddle, fables of the ages,
1473: with broods of children of all ages,
1474: as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
1475: and feather-beds, and birds in cages,
1476: a blessing from its blasts and rages,
1477: There's din of parting now that rages,
1478: and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
1479: Priam-like agricultural sages,
1480: parks, monasteries, towers and ledges,
1481: peasants, and fashion-shops, and sledges,
1482: a rest from toil and all its aches,
1483: upon her lips the breathing dies,
1484: and other, more exacting worries,
1485: resigned himself to prison's ties,
1486: Of course, the love of tender beauties,
1487: that generations of new beauties,
1488: will loyally discharge its duties,
1489: or just grammatical mistakes,
1490: the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
1491: for whom, to expiate your crimes,
1492: you've made so many secret rhymes,
1493: But friendship, as between our heroes,
1494: to comfort her in all her woes,
1495: The crush, the heat, as music blares,
1496: and jam in jars, and household wares,
1497: across the drift-encumbered acres,
1498: and force that purity inspires,
1499: calm men with beatific features,
1500: It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,
1501: Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,
1502: twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
1503: but then a sudden breeze surprises,
1504: frightening with all despair's disguises,
1505: inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
1506: the inevitable silly asses,
1507: Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
1508: High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,
1509: Each others' and their own successes,
1510: the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
1511: the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,

1514: Along the fronts of darkened houses,
1515: Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,

1522: Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
1523: boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,
1524: haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
1525: nonsense will earn indulgent looks,
1526: And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
1527: into the tomb's wide open portals,
1528: the country cottages and hovels,
1529: the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
1530: the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
1531: boys, country women, stately halls,
1532: and hetman of the gambling-halls,

1538: your soul displays, in holy dreams,
1539: empty the purpose it proclaims,

1546: the safest place for declarations,
1547: In days of carefree aspirations,
1548: of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
1549: Legends, and mystical traditions,
1550: No secret crimes, and no perditions,
1551: rumours and threats and premonitions,
1552: old prejudice; all men are zeros,

1564: retired, forgotten by his brothers,
1565: a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
1566: Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
1567: they're all chained up in different fetters,
1568: He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
1569: pans, mattresses, and trunks, and chairs,
1570: flicker of swiftly twirling pairs,
1571: a fashion-plate for illustrators,
1572: another of the ball-dictators,
1573: he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
1574: still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
1575: he'll spend before the looking-glass,
1576: no proud pretentions to success,
1577: and from the salon the princess,
1578: gazes at him... and nonetheless,
1579: a shadow, null and meaningless,
1580: the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
1581: These days I'm finding even gladness,
1582: the atmosphere of youth and madness,
1583: Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
1584: I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
1585: Full of obedience and demureness,
1586: poetic in her simple pureness,
1587: Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
1588: stalking the momentary weakness,
1589: There, with epigrammatic neatness,
1590: against the tea's excessive sweetness,
1591: a Muscovite in Harold's dress,
1592: Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
1593: an elegy to her address,
1594: no haughty stare around the press,
1595: to play with a dishevelled tress,
1596: tracked him, and put him in duress,
1597: Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
1598: she spins and, friend of winter nights,
1599: its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
1600: But when a later age has found us,
1601: as when chill autumn rains surround us,
1602: even in novels, vice entraps us,
1603: Today a mental fog enwraps us,
1604: by dull eternity's purlieus,
1605: for planting cabbage, like Horatius,
1606: He was the slave of a tenacious,

1631: From widow Clicquot and from Moët,
1632: who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
1633: came driving to his country seat,

1635: it held me captive; tit for tat,
1636: in the salon new faces meet,
1637: is it that she, poor simple sweet,
1638: or of Istómina, my sweet,
1639: and enviable for a poet,
1640: no magic fancies of the poet,
1641: prince, who in that dark-red béret,
1642: youth which has nothing to regret,
1643: Already borne down by regret,
1644: and watch your daughters closer yet,
1645: blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
1646: her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
1647: get two young friends to pick a fight,
1648: in the mazurka he was light,
1649: he drives there like a bird in flight,
1650: with visions of enchanted night,
1651: solitude, stillness and the night,
1652: in the deep stillness of the night,
1653: in fashion's din, at still of night,

1658: once more, at that beloved sight,
1659: may chorus, when she comes in sight,
1660: should have been analysed when caught,
1661: one leads the multitude in thought,
1662: when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
1663: You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
1664: Alas, our youth was what we made it,
1665: there's a small window shining in it,
1666: Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
1667: but it's the first time you'll have known it,
1668: a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
1669: The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
1670: flown from society as we know it,
1671: In this, dear reader, if you know it,
1672: Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
1673: of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
1674: choruses, Tanya can but wait,
1675: with trees decked in their silvery kit,
1676: and jolly magpies on the flit,
1677: and good and ill, and learning's fruit,
1678: in his first dream of passion's fruit,
1679: on state affairs; there was a wit,
1680: full of his usual pith and wit,
1681: darkly above the water's lilt,
1682: What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
1683: the condition that it  shall not,  by way of trade or  otherwise,  be  lent,
1684: before first light they have appointment,
1685: The rustic sage, in that apartment,
1686: Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
1687: its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
1688: his young heyday's supreme employment,
1689: But was it happy, his employment,
1690: and yet inseparably present,
1691: remains unmoved: still he's persistent,
1692: there, where the coulisse entrance went,
1693: poor girl, to drop into a faint,
1694: but will, and reason's strong constraint,
1695: and satisfied with what he'd got,
1696: of social buzz and modish riot,
1697: and, curious now about the lot,
1698: made over to them his whole lot,
1699: without a trace of spite or plot,

1702: and fastens, like a term of art,
1703: sharpness of wit, and social art,
1704: fly to my corner like a dart,
1705: it lacked, of course, poetic heart,
1706: the blood within my withered heart,
1707: they shared their days in deed and heart,
1708: with bursts of passion from the heart,
1709: as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
1710: one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
1711: Evgeny loved him from his heart,
1712: by my Eugene, not for his heart,
1713: in the far backwoods' deepest heart,
1714: liven the drowsing of my heart,
1715: your grief would fail to touch my heart,
1716: that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
1717: of jealousy has made her start,
1718: and to it, with a grave import,
1719: one finds in war amusing sport,
1720: dreams of inconsequential cast,
1721: she sits with head sunk on her breast,
1722: another's joy, another's breast,
1723: the hostess cries and, moving fast,
1724: drawn from a dim, warm-hearted past,
1725: whether it goes careering past,
1726: amusing, flattering with the best,
1727: startling the ingenuous with a jest,
1728: the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
1729: I put your genius to the test,
1730: down from the porch, light as the lightest,
1731: of her own horses, not the post,
1732: even by Ladies' Fashion Post,
1733: to pine away from passion's thirst,
1734: by will of Zeus, the high and just,
1735: Alas! the generations must,
1736: With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
1737: have pushed their frontiers further out,

1743: drunk, eaten, yawned, grown weak and stout,
1744: now disenchanted with the next,
1745: more and more bored by yearning's text,
1746: devouring Gibbon and Rousseau,
1747: But now -- oh God! -- the thought of you,
1748: Friendship, as I must own to you,
1749: and counsellor (retired) Flyánov,
1750: and look, my cousin's come, Buyánov,
1751: and, still transparent to the view,
1752: Guillot, behind a stump in view,
1753: the pages of some dull review,
1754: as by the shortest way they flew,
1755: of pity: in his silent bow,
1756: already yawned before the show,
1757: and empty gossip, you'll allow,
1758: Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,
1759: to see you, faithfully to follow,
1760: I only write like this, you know,
1761: only in January the snow,
1762: bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,
1763: I've run a mile, I must avow,
1764: without a goal on which to fix,
1765: of that old duellistic fox,
1766: beyond a string of dull tableaux,
1767: I'd love you, but inside a day,
1768: and then, indoors the livelong day,
1769: Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
1770: the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
1771: always monotonously gay,
1772: alarmed by my melodious lay,
1773: to see life as a ritual play,
1774: Tatyana's love is no by-play,
1775: (in the romantic style, we say,
1776: forgotten features. ``Can you say,

1786: battling along that watery freeway,
1787: and held him briefly in their sway,
1788: stiffening as the hours go by,
1789: We each enjoy a special hobby,
1790: are almost bursting; she's quite ready,
1791: but now, thank God, you're well and steady,
1792: his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
1793: of children, though as young as they,
1794: Amidst the hills, down in that valley,
1795: the cold perfection of the sky,
1796: to boom, to flash across the sky,
1797: and there, beneath your noonday sky,
1798: girls as they passed her spoke less loudly,
1799: the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
1800: Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
1801: is the supreme reward. Precisely,
1802: across green meadows, dilly-dally,
1803: and read my Apuleius keenly,
1804: By now the sun is climbing steeply,
1805: All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,
1806: to dreaming given up unduly,
1807: is represented rather truly,
1808: bright summer days that passed so slowly,
1809: reluctant to exhaust the boy,
1810: on features known, but to that dreary,
1811: bored with hilarity, and weary,
1812: Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,

1822: with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
1823: where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
1824: boredom has just as sure an entry,

2961: on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
2962: no one was ever so engrossed:
2963: the thought sank in, and penetrated:
2964: of light that flowering fields reflected:
2965: where two old pinetrees stand united:
2966: ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
2967: he found too much that he regretted:
2968: sweet old tradition was preserved:
2969: by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:
2970: then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
2971: times were when I was sharp and bold:
2972: until the grave by your strong hand:
2973: the letter from Tatyana's hand:
2974: a hidden beauty in the end:
2975: and give her comfort to the end:
2976: you kept your friendship with our friend:
2977: in any picture of this kind:
2978: can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
2979: commands our rhymester-brotherhood:
2980: out of the hand of that same bard:
2981: Olga's no life in her regard:
2982: I really dote upon the word:
2983: have each asked him to a soirée:
2984: To private tastes we each subscribe:
2985: the men confront them, face to face:
2986: too faint to stir a further pace:
2987: a few books had escaped disgrace:
2988: was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
2989: At least I'll give him some advice:
2990: there was a softness in his glance:
2991: set to well-known children's glee:
2992: to be respected all through life:
2993: how sad the scar of passion's knife:
2994: The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
2995: bright Northern Cleopatra she:
2996: then quietly at last says she:
2997: will disappear as fast as smoke:
2998: with this the hero of my tale:
2999: Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
3000: found that in laughter yawns could stifle:
3001: Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
3002: befitting such a noble pile:
3003: nothing you did gave cause for blame:
3004: to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
3005: I need to rest from all this rhyme:
3006: the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
3007: youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
3008: dreamt of reproving what they'd done:
3009: lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
3010: Moscow has beauties and to spare:
3011: I keep them, and will quote them here:
3012: is with dull trash that can't cohere:
3013: Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
3014: of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
3015: enough of my loquacious lyre:
3016: reflection or provoked dispute:
3017: your early life, unlock your tongue:
3018: Now hear the friends in dialogue:
3019: ages we'd never heard of love:
3020: all was material for transcribing:
3021: and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
3022: be good enough to go on reading:
3023: He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
3024: bottles to which some pitch is clinging:
3025: audacious tunnels will be marching:
3026: calls out his name... All unavailing:
3027: and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
3028: I see another problem looming:
3029: among the guests a general dinning:
3030: and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
3031: Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
3032: He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
3033: the infant year with cheerful greeting:
3034: so long as they're employed in song:
3035: soon all that went without a wrench:
3036: with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
3037: held in constraint by pity's touch:
3038: and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
3039: Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
3040: over it a mysterious wreath:
3041: There once I too strolled back and forth:
3042: of traveller's tedium at its peak:
3043: says the old lady in a croak:
3044: these words are not of Russian stock:
3045: any Madonna by Van Dyck:
3046: was an enchanting country nook:
3047: makes to her nurse low-voiced remark:
3048: his thoughts were on a distant goal:
3049: then from the Muse there came revival:
3050: and sink to prose's humble level:
3051: enquired the lady of the hall:
3052: from the agent, with this tale to tell:
3053: But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
3054: I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
3055: But ever stranger and more fearful:
3056: Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
3057: at sunken wax inside a bowl:
3058: untirable, at sound of drum:
3059: You've guessed before it all began:
3060: and even honourable man:
3061: Up to the porch our hero's driven:
3062: the rogue has got a finger frozen:
3063: yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
3064: Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
3065: excited not a hint of passion:
3066: gives way to nature's normal passion:
3067: My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
3068: how I interpret this expression:
3069: with every sort of home possession:
3070: hell's terrifying imprecation:
3071: Sign of the urge for domination:
3072: he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
3073: had long proved tedious to distraction:
3074: I gave no rein to sweet affection:
3075: Another page of recollection:
3076: The Larins kept the old tradition:
3077: Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
3078: then, on the last page, the suggestion:
3079: On the first sheet you'll find a question:
3080: to demonstrate some signs of reason:
3081: her heart had long been overrun:
3082: and roused the village long ago:
3083: the wine-addict adores the cup:
3084: at the same moment in her ear:
3085: so Lensky answered the old dear:
3086: She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
3087: they talk of her, of how and whether:
3088: while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
3089: Conjecture found unending matter:
3090: No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
3091: with tears, in quarters of the maids:
3092: The protocol is all one wishes:
3093: (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:
3094: the prince looks at him, and replies:
3095: Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
3096: then quickly something changed all this:
3097: then, help me God, she caterwauls:
3098: the funeral monument explains:
3099: jaws masticate as minutes pass:
3100: feeling to what had long been heartless:
3101: but Eugene's out from din and press:
3102: they all still keep their old impress:
3103: And with a smile the world caressed us:
3104: those monkeys of the good old days:
3105: will blossom into splendid highways:
3106: gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:
3107: objective of his thoughts and joys:
3108: on me, all this has no effect:
3109: a simple Russian family night:
3110: you're sure to find her portrait in it:
3111: in your pursuit I've come to know it:
3112: Listen to me without resentment:
3113: to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
3114: Olinka and her mother sent:
3115: active, and hopeful, and insistent:
3116: I acted thoughtlessly or not:
3117: I've paid my due to classic art:
3118: despite herself, rehearsed the part:
3119: and should have played a different part:
3120: about what's buried in the past:
3121: in other things you come off best:
3122: when he arrived; not in the slightest:
3123: spoke words of hope? But who are you:
3124: with each nuance of wintry glow:
3125: I'd still like dances to this day:
3126: praised his fierce courage in its day:
3127: at my famed portrait and will say:
3128: like a sweet child. She'll never say:
3129: But you're not sociable, they say:
3130: explodes; wine fizzes up... but stay:
3131: his hours to dreaming them away:
3132: each of us has his favourite lobby:
3133: ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:
3134: on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
3135: in unison repeat the cry:
3136: but Tanya found she couldn't cry:
3137: in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
3138: there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
3139: That isn't our immediate worry:
3140: is this -- one sees from here the party:
3141: Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
3142: and, under, ``toute à vous Annette'';
3143: when we begin to talk of verse);
3144: (my tale's beginning here repeats);
3145: in Adam Smith was his diploma;
3146: Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;
3147: I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
3148: Eugene's response was automatic;
3149: of spring he lives, he's energetic;
3150: no deathless truths, nothing scholastic;
3151: the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
3152: Lel6 floats about above her head;
3153: rapture was just two weeks ahead;
3154: on the dull life that bachelors lead;
3155: before the fire a table's spread;
3156: to drive the swooning senses mad;
3157: and heartless pleasure was up-graded;
3158: he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
3159: High ceilings everywhere abounded;
3160: By chance those verses haven't vanished;
3161: he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
3162: Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
3163: beneath a shroud that's all dishevelled;
3164: in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
3165: her manner is no less contained;
3166: how many follies were engendered;
3167: if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
3168: both hearts to blaze had now expired;
3169: filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;
3170: her hands affectionately pressed;
3171: they've moved around and been reseated;
3172: The clock of doom had struck as fated;
3173: on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
3174: by deep and shady woods protected;
3175: the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
3176: the downy woods are greener-tinted;
3177: a hundred times afresh distorted;
3178: the strophe over which I slaved;
3179: Russian pancakes were always served;
3180: at thirty, lucratively wed;
3181: perhaps for fame, he was endowed;
3182: and blood had bubbled as it flowed;
3183: and soon will day's bright tune be played;
3184: while she's from top to toe surveyed;
3185: had been imposed by winter's hand;
3186: I feel a small foot in my hand;
3187: more searching than Chateaubriand;
3188: with me to see an alien strand;
3189: and on their marks has made them stand;
3190: same Pom, same husband to the end;
3191: his choice could shock or might offend;
3192: in grief that nothing else could mend;
3193: Martin Zadéka fails to mend;
3194: unfathomable to the mind;
3195: she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
3196: of mind got clarity new-found;
3197: from Million Street16 came floating round;
3198: by dreary snowdrifts piled around;
3199: gazes at all the scene around;
3200: as it assembles them around;
3201: close as a shadow on the ground;
3202: emotion, thought, and magic sound;
3203: with our poor girl was kind and good;
3204: and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;
3205: there's not a word she's understood;
3206: the source's chattering voice is heard;
3207: and everything is cramped and loud;
3208: while a mazurka holds the crowd;
3209: play on the window's frosted lace;
3210: up the hillside at breakneck pace;
3211: sigh, and stood up, began to pace;
3212: fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;
3213: their joyous way across the ice;
3214: would launch into self-sacrifice;
3215: girls' albums, signed in blood for choice;
3216: conversing in a singsong voice;
3217: such good and sensible advice;
3218: from any gentlemanly distance;
3219: into the tomb's mysterious shade;
3220: had come to him in field and glade;
3221: they heap up silver with a spade;
3222: past the grand ladies, see her glide;
3223: to help her from the other side;
3224: since then my heart was wrenched aside;
3225: Tatyana groaned above the tide;
3226: that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
3227: of every funeral far and wide;
3228: becomes a horse for all to see;
3229: with demoiselles of riper age;
3230: not even in her earliest age;
3231: Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
3232: is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
3233: Omens dismayed her with their presage;
3234: at first she had no heart to range;
3235: and in her grief seemed fit to die;
3236: for what's been given us to take;
3237: bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
3238: and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
3239: years back, to call up many a fable;
3240: who never learnt how dreamers babble;
3241: who never scorned the social rabble;
3242: and frames would shudder, windows tremble;
3243: he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
3244: He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
3245: foretells for her some wondrous role;
3246: there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
3247: allow no rest to you or me;
3248: that fired his soul, to burn the same;
3249: self-willed it may be just the same;
3250: of something vague, some misty clime;
3251: grew hardened to life's frosty clime;
3252: from ball to bed behold him come;
3253: no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;
3254: sang for the guests above the wine;
3255: Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
3256: to infuriate a clumsy foe;
3257: consequences of hideous woe;
3258: Pikhtín, of the Hussars, was here;
3259: the faces met with everywhere;
3260: of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
3261: secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
3262: the full fruit of her heart's desire;
3263: jealousy's flame, to light desire;
3264: I could describe here his attire;
3265: you were the first ones he forswore;
3266: his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
3267: on stage are thumping without cease;
3268: I never lived or wrote for praise;
3269: for tempests and for feasts and noise;
3270: and he was bored with social noise;
3271: here there's no conscience, here no sense;
3272: the allée to the lake, the copse;
3273: the horses fidget worse and worse;
3274: sets out upon her homeward course;
3275: by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
3276: were all the law that I would use;
3277: their unattractive tête-à-tête;
3278: would be allied to him by fate;
3279: the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
3280: is tinsel on a life I hate;
3281: he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
3282: scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
3283: from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
3284: relined and strengthened for the drive;
3285: in ink with colour-wash above;
3286: men made their bows, and sought her eye;
3287: not only by Evgeny's eye;
3288: and leant upon the granite shelf;
3289: its furrow through the powdery icing;
3290: behind her followed wildly dancing;
3291: Bacchante-like, her flighty prancing;
3292: while in the hut a girl is singing;
3293: Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
3294: and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;
3295: after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
3296: Then, after midday he'll be waking;
3297: such is the usual country cooking;
3298: towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
3299: when night patrol's a perilous calling;
3300: Silence was everywhere enthralling;
3301: to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
3302: you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
3303: to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
3304: shelter for trysts at every turning;
3305: one wallows in delicious weeping;
3306: still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
3307: her golden earrings off and whipping;
3308: the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
3309: here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
3310: to his disputing and his cursing;
3311: but ladies' hands are not for kissing;
3312: everything's dim and unenthusing;
3313: even the scandal's not amusing;
3314: she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
3315: he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
3316: what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
3317: a story that still wants completing;
3318: that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
3319: We too shall find our hour is waiting;
3320: Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
3321: he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
3322: and all is lost beyond retrieving;
3323: lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;
3324: roses romantically blowing;
3325: his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
3326: and good old sun more seldom glowing;
3327: Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
3328: it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
3329: dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
3330: and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;
3331: neighbours in high content are wheezing;
3332: the Russian N, like N in French;
3333: once I too liked it very much;
3334: a portrait with a charming touch;
3335: breaks a new passage with his sleigh;
3336: impatient, hatred flaming high;
3337: and offer to that ash a sigh;
3338: the bloom has withered on the bough;
3339: choked up. There's no wreath on the bough;
3340: and arm in arm they all go through;
3341: I count each hour the whole day through;
3342: Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;
3343: accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
3344: towards the simple urn beneath;
3345: bringing her unity and strength;
3346: only to Eugene showed their worth;
3347: parodies winter in the south;
3348: nanny, companion of my youth;
3349: a crayfish rides on spider-back;
3350: and swaggers in a red calpack;
3351: the branches of the oak with flock;
3352: across the fields, round hill and rock;
3353: the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
3354: even without me it will sink;
3355: by Lensky in his Olga's book;
3356: more closely at the grammar-book;
3357: by ancient limes, or by a brook;
3358: the cooks prepare the midday meal;
3359: of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
3360: I find myself no longer equal;
3361: my soul in secret gave survival;
3362: had killed his best friend in a duel;
3363: was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
3364: I have no leisure to recall;
3365: shall make my story grim as hell;
3366: he trembles, knows not what to tell;
3367: he reached the stream below the hill;
3368: at two-ball billiards prove his skill;
3369: he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
3370: no word came flowing from his quill;
3371: engaged then -- but against her will;
3372: he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
3373: that wit embarrasses the dull;
3374: to the complacent and the null;
3375: with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
3376: in her torn heart -- a fickle gleam;
3377: the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
3378: has taken on a silvery gleam;
3379: to spoil loose paper by the ream;
3380: meanwhile a hallboy handed cream;
3381: O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
3382: the shady wood, the talking stream;
3383: goes by default: the  touching lyrical  beauty, the cynical wit of the poem;
3384: He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
3385: life's real meaning would have found him;
3386: already there she stands beside him;
3387: ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
3388: despite herself, is Lensky's doom;
3389: far-distant heaven's vaulted room;
3390: clears in a flash the freezing room;
3391: claiming Tatyana'd found her man;
3392: walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
3393: but now the mansion is forsaken;
3394: you find the country godforsaken;
3395: Departure date's long overtaken;
3396: Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
3397: comrades despised, and comrades rotten;
3398: The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
3399: fat Pústyakov has driven in;
3400: levy their tribute on the plain;
3401: in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
3402: and parts the fringes of his curtain;
3403: with comedies of swarm and din;
3404: whose serfs are miserably thin;
3405: alone, with no adornment on;
3406: the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
3407: to battle further with my passion;
3408: Zaretsky rose without discussion;
3409: your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
3410: I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
3411: dear Tanya, lover of illusion;
3412: O Adrian waves, my invocation;
3413: and all our modish education;
3414: it mastered him in slow gradation;
3415: rebuffed, found instant consolation;
3416: Compliment and congratulation;
3417: And home was now their destination;
3418: the coach has reached its destination;
3419: Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
3420: the universe is all perfection;
3421: and always the self-same objection;
3422: is lost in obstinate reflection;
3423: ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;
3424: The flirt has reason's cool volition;
3425: I'm blind to every apparition;
3426: a truly noble disposition;
3427: she drinks it like a priceless potion;
3428: and it deceived us in return;
3429: as battles go, I've not begun;
3430: from daybreak valleys lift the sun;
3431: in the full beauty of its frown;
3432: the latest fashions of the town;
3433: I married. I beseech you, go;
3434: she flies as fast as she can go;
3435: thought them a pointless peccadillo;
3436: her handkerchief has fallen too;
3437: but spared no glance for Cicero;
3438: that night, in secret, set for two;
3439: over the waters in a sweep;
3440: the letter trembles in her grip;
3441: here's Petushkóv, the local fop;
3442: delicious novels, laps them up;
3443: in his defence, and smash it up;
3444: wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
3445: with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
3446: the talk of guests when they appear;
3447: and Dunya works the samovar;
3448: comes for awakening, comes for slumber;
3449: I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
3450: and from within come noise and cheer;
3451: A backward look is fraught with danger;
3452: The city's early sounds awake her;
3453: His life went sailing in calm weather;
3454: Some neighbours there have come together;
3455: I'll part them, bring them back together;
3456: their lords, and thwack their palms together;
3457: Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
3458: rendered them tedious to each other;
3459: No moralizing from this joker;
3460: faceted muzzles by the rammer;
3461: he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
3462: bring up a table, and a taper;
3463: spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;
3464: find, in the trivial, serious matter;
3465: with his forefathers would seem better;
3466: add vale when he signed a letter;
3467: still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
3468: glitters beneath its icing-sliver;
3469: Our love is what they most abhor;
3470: the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
3471: from table, clattering on the floor;
3472: he'd listen to the administrator;
3473: in corners whispering girls concur;
3474: by way of toast to their fair neighbour;
3475: clock in the country rings the hour;
3476: Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
3477: its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
3478: There's powdery snow up to her knees;
3479: Love tyrannises all the ages;
3480: the jams appear in little dishes;
3481: of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
3482: by any itch for marriage ties;
3483: of goblets, tall and slender pretties;
3484: that verse will turn to useful duties;
3485: brushes on thirty different scales;
3486: the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
3487: no one recalls him or his verses;
3488: the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
3489: Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
3490: all sorts of hopeless appetites;
3491: like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
3492: that ardent youth entirely lacks;
3493: to scorn the men with whom he deals;
3494: and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
3495: the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
3496: the snow from all surrounding hills;
3497: for us are instruments and tools;
3498: to sleep some black and empty dreams;
3499: a Russian family's old traditions;
3500: poor Tanya more intensely burns;
3501: I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
3502: on unknown ladies in the tiers;
3503: printed among outmoded airs;
3504: adorns Aunt Helen, the princess;
3505: with an avowal just as artless;
3506: that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
3507: at least by a regretful kindness;
3508: that could sustain it? Only grimness;
3509: bespectacled, in tattered dress;
3510: the ladies' calculated dress;
3511: evoke for you a sombre bliss;
3512: The yard was bursting with dependants;
3513: culture, so far from healing, hurts us;
3514: in rose-trimmed bonnets, but malicious;
3515: the bear has raised her in his paws;
3516: no move she makes, no breath she draws;
3517: reap a brief harvest on their furrows;
3518: right from the cradle of her days;
3519: and every plea that lips can treat;
3520: by clearing every sort of debt;
3521: of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
3522: and kisses smack as young girls greet;
3523: on her conquest, we leave my sweet;
3524: we'll draw it deeper in our net;
3525: may wind up my career as poet;
3526: outside and in they star the night;
3527: once more he can't await the night;
3528: the happenings of the previous night;

3572: along the street lies dirty snow;
3573: lived to the age of twenty-six;
3574: two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
3575: Onegin had no word to say;
3576: a shambling hoof along the way;
3577: with custom, love would fade away;
3578: an ace a dozen yards away;
3579: dowagers smiled as she went by;

3583: The two old ladies kiss and cry;
3584: once more Corneille's majestic story;

3613: torment of pride? And why's he come?
3614: to all that's trivial and inane?
3615: ``How long has he been on the scene?

3627: is this the riddle's missing clue?
3628: is this then what you can't forgive?
3629: why fight what's known to be decisive?
3630: it can't be youth's distemper -- love?
3631: with years no more to meet our gaze?
3632: Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
3633: Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
3634: inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?
3635: is this the man that you were seeking?
3636: Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
3637: that strikes him with such force and meaning?
3638: over the slush, where is he chasing?
3639: Then what resulted from the meeting?
3640: Can she have found the enigma's setting?
3641: ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?

3809: the time to go has long since passed
3810: forests where my young age was passed

3850: singing in chorus as directed
3851: But my Eugene that night directed
3852: once on the highway he'd detected
3853: there was no trace to be detected
3854: Thronged by adorers, I've detected
3855: their masters' berries undetected
3856: I know, Godsent one, I'm protected

3861: No path to see: the snow has drifted
3862: his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
3863: And suddenly her radiance lighted
3864: He was too young to have been blighted
3865: Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
3866: that on the world's staircase there waited
3867: with recent fortune, vainly waited
3868: love's crown, delectable, awaited
3869: she sang of childhood's fun, indited

3871: Yet -- fear itself she found presented
3872: in tears and violent tossing vented
3873: our disposition being invented

3876: his mind's eye focused on the hinted
3877: Since earliest boyhood he had doted
3878: with tenderness he'd watched and noted
3879: But it was passion that preempted
3880: she sighed, and in a trance coopted
3881: Outside the gate Tatyana parted
3882: but soon the ways we trod were parted
3883: Between them, every topic started
3884: Eugene would willingly have started
3885: Now for the first time she's escorted
3886: Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
3887: jealously, shyly, I've imported
3888: which smilingly your friend, supported
3889: She was like him and always sported
3890: but, without asking, they transported
3891: Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
3892: With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
3893: forehead, he strummed, his vision flitted
3894: before the clavichord with knitted
3895: that she's so trustful, and imbued
3896: by heaven with such an unsubdued

3898: by pain and languishment; she craved
3899: for maybe fortune will have saved
3900: All rights reserved
3901: by now his bride-to-be has wed
3902: and hope and passion; life had glowed
3903: the trail the youthful poet followed
3904: a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
3905: or Freischütz as it might be played
3906: and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
3907: he's lost his self-command, and crazed
3908: among the guests she recognized
3909: the lucky bard, and as he dozed
3910: a masculine disguise to aid
3911: and those we sing for will be paid
3912: Her eyes were opened, and she said
3913: his awkwardness, he's hardly said
3914: stumblingly call to mind he did
3915: but at the window, in the splendid

5053: his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
5054: before she goes, she seeks permission
5055: Evgeny, whom the repercussion
5056: As soon as he appears, discussion
5057: expose his soul to an intrusion
5058: Her loving spouse with approbation
5059: Tatyana sees with trepidation
5060: etcetera. But her trepidation
5061: the millions of two-legged creation
5062: have you read lines of your creation
5063: She'll not see him, her obligation
5064: he strove to achieve the appropriation
5065: the prince bring up his own relation
5066: This wearisome perambulation
5067: in time (to quote the calculation
5068: But here, with our congratulation
5069: To batten down their indignation
5070: somehow have got the designation
5071: pride's icy calm, the combination
5072: before his eyes, imagination
5073: thank God, he had no inclination
5074: I'm altering my destination
5075: Even at home his occupation
5076: but the salon's preoccupation
5077: A moment earlier, inspiration
5078: with careful schemes of decoration
5079: with fond caress? whose adoration
5080: When progress and amelioration
5081: She enjoys the stately orchestration
5082: and in the misted condensation
5083: with our Mamas, and a sensation
5084: this was our heroes' conversation
5085: and logic; yet the conversation
5086: To talk, to general conversation
5087: Left-handed from the habitation
5088: Lost in our backwoods habitation
5089: In time, who knows, the agitation
5090: ``I?'' ``Saturday. The invitation
5091: another bard1 in exaltation
5092: you see, with tears and incantation
5093: So to his wife for presentation
5094: thrives to this moment, in a station
5095: mother implored me; my sad station
5096: how soon the bounds of rank and station
5097: < My gaze pursues them... but on station
5098: And from the nearby Army station
5099: had filled this heart, and detestation
5100: must be to hold in detestation
5101: When Eugene's turn for salutation
5102: Tatyana listened with vexation
5103: The kinsfolk in concerted action
5104: of his intent; and a reaction
5105: of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
5106: for nature's unadorned reaction
5107: the quintessential reaction
5108: the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
5109: she can't make out a single fraction
5110: present her languor and distraction
5111: Tatyana never knew the attraction
5112: It's true, the magnet-like attraction
5113: But you perhaps find no attraction
5114: In time past, objects of affection
5115: Whatever in this rough confection
5116: worthier of you in the perfection
5117: showed one a pattern of perfection
5118: arrested by the sheer perfection
5119: and charming reverie's vain deflection
5120: a dream's mute monument, reflection
5121: He lacked the slightest predilection
5122: To reading from this odd collection
5123: But, as it is, this pied collection
5124: but groomed an anecdote-collection
5125: absorbed me in the recollection
5126: Walking her horse in introspection
5127: but where such hymns in my direction
5128: how dull to work for the correction
5129: All right, you want the resurrection
5130: Meanwhile my novel's opening section
5131: Tanya's distress had risked detection
5132: my span, that fortune's jurisdiction
5133: from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction
5134: meticulously; in my fiction
5135: I must wake up with the conviction
5136: Tatyana shared with full conviction
5137: it stood, defiant of destruction
5138: The château was of a construction
5139: I know it's now in your discretion
5140: How soft his glance, or at discretion
5141: I would have had the indiscretion
5142: into his look, the exhibition
5143: he changed the corvée of tradition
5144: the unmetric verses of tradition
5145: only by rule, and strict tradition
5146: she yields to it without condition
5147: or some vile agent of perdition
5148: and yet a distant admonition
5149: of the two girls; their premonition
5150: Protect me from such apparition
5151: Vladimir to this casual mention
5152: and so he lacks the strength to mention
5153: but I've not got the least intention
5154: he's bowed politely; his attention
5155: Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
5156: and all their ravishing invention
5157: Zaretsky draws up a convention
5158: Could it not be that by convention
5159: in our affair, the intervention
5160: our hapless Tanya! An emotion
5161: Tatyana in a deep emotion
5162: of wild repentance and devotion
5163: More tolerant in his conception
5164: though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
5165: freedom and peace, in substitution
5166: But now the radiance of the moon
5167: thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
5168: is dimmed. Down there the valley soon
5169: Byron
5170: to burn -- and then by force of reason
5171: But what about Eugene? With reason
5172: if I'd possessed the slightest reason
5173: is a compulsive bore by reason
5174: of your slim prints! though this be treason
5175: The days flew past; by now the season
5176: How fearful, in and out of season
5177: he drives up in and out of season
5178: At first I thought it out of season
5179: of fate, and life, each in its turn
5180: that alien scene must I now turn
5181: a ball in Petersburg; but fun
5182: begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
5183: entertainment, and which,  ideally,  might even be able to stand on  its own
5184: Imagine it: quite on my own
5185: due punishment was handed down
5186: till he at last was summoned down
5187: the branches all are weighted down
5188: whose kindly hand will ruffle down
5189: of Muses' offspring; sitting down
5190: not every day could he wash down
5191: sleep much, read little, and put down
5192: moves the young watcher (as was known
5193: his beefsteak with champagne, or drown

5195: she'd cheer my wordless way, and do
5196: she did what nurse advised she do
5197: Onegin without more ado
5198: is that my feet lack strength to go
5199: see with their jugs the milk-girls go
5200: have drenched the steel bit as they go
5201: a frequent question: ``tell me who
5202: with a Venetian maiden who
5203: was brought there by a huckster who
5204: it will be our descendants who

5208: his conscience's record, and so
5209: with your good offices, and so
5210: they were her only food... and so
5211: made all fates look the same... and so

5240: myself and Eugene, lest a reader
5241: of mocking turn, or else a breeder
5242: and yet in vain ennui I squander
5243: ``Can it be she?'' Eugene in wonder
5244: ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
5245: Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
5246: rushed to Anisia's room, to plunder
5247: her heart speaks to her even louder
5248: Her passion burns with stronger powder
5249: word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer

5251: but from her shaggy-liveried ranger
5252: some future dunce will point a finger
5253: ``I weep... In case there still should linger

5258: her soul's attention; just behind her
5259: around her neck, or when for her
5260: into a corner, gently makes her

31: --------
32: Translator's note
33: Few foreign masterpieces can have suffered more than Eugene Onegin from
34: the English  translator's failure to convey anything more than -- at best --
35: the literal meaning.  It is  as if  a  sound-proof wall separated  Pushkin's
36: poetic novel from the English-reading world.  There  is  a whole magic which
37: goes by default: the  touching lyrical  beauty, the cynical wit of the poem;
38: the  psychological  insight,  the  devious  narrative  skill, the thrilling,
39: compulsive  grip of the novel; the tremendous gusto and swing and panache of
40: the whole performance.
41: Vladimir Nabokov's rendering into unrhymed iambics reproduces the exact
42: meaning, but explicitly disclaims any further ambition. While Nabokov admits
43: that  in  losing  its  rhyme   the  work  loses  its  ``bloom''  he  argues,
44: irrefutably,  that  no rhyming  version  can  be literally  accurate. It can
45: however certainly strive  for something else. It can attempt to produce some
46: substitute for  the ``bloom'' of  the original, without  which the  work  is
47: completely  dead.  It  can try to convey the poet's tone  of voice,  whether
48: world-weary  or romantic, the sparkle  of  his jokes,  the  flavour  of  his
49: epigrams, the snap of his  final couplets. None of these effects can  emerge
50: from  a  purely  literal  unrhymed  translation.  In  fact,  to  offset  the
51: inevitable  loss in verbal  exactness,  a  rhyming  version  can  aim  at  a
52: different sort of accuracy, an equivalence or parallelism conveying, however
53: faintly, the impact of the original.
54: Apart from the overall  difficulty of  his  task, the  translator  with
55: ambitions of this  type will find  that Pushkin's work presents him with two
56: particular problems.
57: The brio of the Russian text partly depends on a lavish use not only of
58: French and other foreign words, but of  slang and of  audacious Byronic-type
59: rhymes.  If  the  translator produces nothing comparable, he is emasculating
60: his original. If he attempts to follow suit, he must  do all he can to avoid
61: the pitfalls of the embarrassing, the facetious and the arch. {29}
62: Secondly, he must be on his guard against the ludicrous effect that the
63: feminine  ending (for instance the pleasure/measure rhyme, which is so  much
64: derided by Nabokov) can all too easily produce in English. He must not sing,
65: like Prince Gremin in one English version of Chaykovsky's opera:
66: ``I wouldn't be remotely human
67: Did I not love the Little Woman.''
68: (The libretto of the opera, which was  written and first performed more
69: than  forty  years  after  Pushkin's  death,  is by  Chaykovsky  himself and
70: Konstantin Shilovsky, a minor  poet of the time.  It  is  nominally based on
71: Pushkin's text, but in fact the relationship is not very close.)
72: Anyway, it should  be possible now, with  the help of Nabokov's literal
73: translation and commentary, to produce a reasonably accurate rhyming version
74: of  Pushkin's  work  which   can  at  least  be   read  with   pleasure  and
75: entertainment, and which,  ideally,  might even be able to stand on  its own
76: feet as English. That, in all humility, is the aim of the present text.

78: permission to quote from Vladimir Nabokov's notes in volumes 2 and 3 of  his
79: edition of Eugene Onegin (London, 1964. Revised edition, 1976).
80: I  am much  indebted  to  my  friends Sir Sacheverell Sitwell, for  his
81: interest  and  support,  and  Sir  John  Balfour,  for  his   searching  and
82: constructive criticism of the  translation;  to  Professor  Gleb Struve, for
83: generously  giving me the benefit of his unrivalled scholarship and insight;
84: above all, to my wife Natasha, for her loving encouragement.

89: Pétri de  vanité,  il  avait encore plus de cette espèce  d'orgueil qui

97: Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
98: I prize the attention of my friends,
99: and only wish that my employment
100: could have been turned to worthier ends --
101: worthier of you in the perfection
102: your soul displays, in holy dreams,
103: in simple but sublime reflection,
104: in limpid verse that lives and gleams.
105: But, as it is, this pied collection
106: begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
107: from threads both sad and humoristic,
108: themes popular or idealistic,
109: products of carefree hours, of fun,
110: of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
111: of powers unripe, or on the wane,
112: of reason's icy intimations,
113: and records of a heart in pain.

117: To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
118: Prince Vyazemsky
119: I
120: ``My uncle -- high ideals inspire him;
121: but when past joking he fell sick,
122: he really forced one to admire him --
123: and never played a shrewder trick.
124: Let others learn from his example!
125: But God, how deadly dull to sample
126: sickroom attendance night and day
127: and never stir a foot away!
128: And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
129: of entertaining the half-dead:
130: one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
131: and glumly serves the medicine bottle,
132: and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
133: "When will the devil come for you?"''
134: {35}
135: II
136: Such were a young rake's meditations --
137: by will of Zeus, the high and just,
138: the legatee of his relations --
139: as horses whirled him through the dust.
140: Friends of my Ruslan and Lyudmila,
141: without preliminary feeler
142: let me acquaint you on the nail
143: with this the hero of my tale:
144: Onegin, my good friend, was littered
145: and bred upon the Neva's brink,
146: where you were born as well, I think,
147: reader, or where you've shone and glittered!
148: There once I too strolled back and forth:
149: but I'm allergic to the North...1
150: III
151: After a fine career, his father
152: had only debts on which to live.
153: He gave three balls a year, and rather
154: promptly had nothing left to give.
155: Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:
156: at first Madame gave him tuition,
157: from her Monsieur took on the child.
158: He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
159: Monsieur l'Abbé, the mediocre,
160: reluctant to exhaust the boy,
161: treated his lessons as a ploy.
162: No moralizing from this joker;
163: a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
164: and then a stroll in Letny Park.
165: {36}
166: IV
167: But when the hour of youthful passion
168: struck for Evgeny, with its play
169: of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
170: it was goodbye, Monsieur l'Abbé.
171: Eugene was free, and as a dresser
172: made London's dandy his professor.
173: His hair was fashionably curled,
174: and now at last he saw the World.
175: In French Onegin had perfected
176: proficiency to speak and write,
177: in the mazurka he was light,
178: his bow was wholly unaffected.
179: The World found this enough to treat
180: Eugene as clever, and quite sweet.
181: V
182: We all meandered through our schooling
183: haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
184: it's easy, without too much fooling,
185: to pass for cultured in our ranks.
186: Onegin was assessed by many
187: (critical judges, strict as any)
188: as well-read, though of pedant cast.
189: Unforced, as conversation passed,
190: he had the talent of saluting
191: felicitously every theme,
192: of listening like a judge-supreme
193: while serious topics were disputing,
194: or, with an epigram-surprise,
195: of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
196: {37}
197: VI
198: Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
199: yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
200: Onegin knew enough to savour
201: the meaning of an epigraph,
202: make Juvenal his text, or better
203: add vale when he signed a letter;
204: stumblingly call to mind he did
205: two verses of the Aeneid.
206: He lacked the slightest predilection
207: for raking up historic dust
208: or stirring annalistic must;
209: but groomed an anecdote-collection
210: that stretched from Romulus in his prime
211: across the years to our own time.
212: VII
213: He was without that dithyrambic
214: frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
215: and telling trochee from iambic
216: was quite beyond his wit, we found.
217: He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
218: in Adam Smith was his diploma;
219: our deep economist had got
220: the gift of recognizing what
221: a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
222: and how a country lives, and why
223: it needs no gold if a supply
224: of simple product supplements it.
225: His father failed to understand
226: and took a mortgage on his land.
227: {38}
228: VIII
229: Evgeny's total store of knowledge
230: I have no leisure to recall;
231: where he was master of his college,
232: the art he'd studied best of all,
233: his young heyday's supreme employment,
234: its work, its torture, its enjoyment,
235: what occupied his chafing powers
236: throughout the boredom of the hours --
237: this was the science of that passion
238: which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
239: condemned to a lifetime of hard,
240: ended his wild career of fashion
241: deep in Moldavia the abhorred,
242: far, far from Italy, his adored.
243: (IX,2) X
244: How early he'd learnt to dissemble,
245: to hide a hope, to make a show
246: of jealousy, to seem to tremble
247: or pine, persuade of yes or no,
248: and act the humble or imperious,
249: the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
250: In languid silence, or the flame
251: of eloquence, and just the same
252: in casual letters of confession --
253: one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
254: and self-oblivion was his art!
255: How soft his glance, or at discretion
256: how bold or bashful there, and here
257: how brilliant with its instant tear!
258: {39}
259: XI
260: How well he donned new shapes and sizes --
261: startling the ingenuous with a jest,
262: frightening with all despair's disguises,
263: amusing, flattering with the best,
264: stalking the momentary weakness,
265: with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
266: swaying the artless, waiting on
267: for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
268: then he'd implore a declaration,
269: and listen for the heart's first sound,
270: pursue his love -- and at one bound
271: secure a secret assignation,
272: then afterwards, alone, at ease,
273: impart such lessons as you please!
274: XII
275: How early on he learnt to trouble
276: the heart of the professional flirt!
277: When out to burst a rival's bubble,
278: how well he knew the way to hurt --
279: what traps he'd set him, with what malice
280: he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
281: But you, blest husbands, to the end
282: you kept your friendship with our friend:
283: the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
284: Faublas'3 disciple for an age --
285: as was the old suspicious sage,
286: and the majestic, antlered royal,
287: always contented with his life,
288: and with his dinner, and his wife.
289: {40}
290: (XIII, XIV,) XV
291: Some days he's still in bed, and drowses,
292: when little notes come on a tray.
293: What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
294: have each asked him to a soirée:
295: a ball here, there a children's party;
296: where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
297: Which one comes first? It's just the same
298: to do them all is easy game.
299: Meanwhile, attired for morning strolling
300: complete with broad-brimmed bolivar,
301: Eugene attends the boulevard,
302: and there at large he goes patrolling
303: until Bréguet's unsleeping chime
304: advises him of dinner-time.
305: XVI
306: He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
307: ``Make way, make way,'' goes up the shout;
308: his collar in its beaver braiding
309: glitters with hoar-frost all about.
310: He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
311: that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
312: he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
313: wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
314: before him roast beef, red and gory,
315: and truffles, which have ever been
316: youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
317: and pâté, Strasbourg's deathless glory,
318: sits with Limburg's vivacious cheese
319: and ananas, the gold of trees.
320: {41}
321: XVII
322: More wine, he calls, to drench the flaming
323: fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
324: when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
325: the new ballet he should be at.
326: He's off -- this ruthless legislator
327: for the footlights, this fickle traitor
328: to all the most adored actrices,
329: this denizen of the coulisses
330: that world where every man's a critic
331: who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
332: at Cleopatra, hiss her off,
333: boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
334: encore Moëna,7 -- and rejoice
335: to know the audience hears his voice.
336: XVIII
337: Enchanted land! There like a lampion
338: that king of the satiric scene,
339: Fonvizin8 sparkled, freedom's champion,
340: and the derivative Knyazhnín:8
341: there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
342: tribute of tears, applause's shrilling,
343: with young Semyónova,9 and there
344: our friend Katénin8 brought to bear
345: once more Corneille's majestic story;
346: there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
347: with comedies of swarm and din;
348: there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
349: there, where the coulisse entrance went,
350: that's where my years of youth were spent.
351: {42}
352: XIX
353: My goddesses! Where are you banished?
354: lend ears to my lugubrious tone:
355: have other maidens, since you vanished,
356: taken your place, though not your throne?
357: your chorus, is it dead for ever?
358: Russia's Terpsichore, shall never
359: again I see your soulful flight?
360: shall my sad gaze no more alight
361: on features known, but to that dreary,
362: that alien scene must I now turn
363: my disillusioned glass, and yearn,
364: bored with hilarity, and weary,
365: and yawn in silence at the stage
366: as I recall a bygone age?
367: XX
368: The house is packed out; scintillating,
369: the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
370: the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
371: and up the rustling curtain crawls.
372: Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
373: bound where the magic bow will send her,
374: Istómina,11 thronged all around
375: by Naiads, one foot on the ground,
376: twirls the other slowly as she pleases,
377: then suddenly she's off, and there
378: she's up and flying through the air
379: like fluff before Aeolian breezes;
380: she'll spin this way and that, and beat
381: against each other swift, small feet.
382: {43}
383: XXI
384: Applause. Onegin enters -- passes
385: across the public's toes; he steers
386: straight to his stall, then turns his glasses
387: on unknown ladies in the tiers;
388: he's viewed the boxes without passion,
389: he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
390: he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
391: to gentlemen on every side
392: he's bowed politely; his attention
393: wanders in a distracted way
394: across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
395: they all have richly earned a pension;''
396: he turns away: ``I've had enough --
397: now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''
398: XXII
399: Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid
400: on stage are thumping without cease;
401: Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
402: the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
403: the audience still is busy stamping,
404: still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
405: still everywhere the lamps are bright;
406: outside and in they star the night;
407: still shivering in the bitter weather
408: the horses fidget worse and worse;
409: the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
410: their lords, and thwack their palms together;
411: but Eugene's out from din and press:
412: by now he's driving home to dress.
413: {44}
414: XXIII
415: Shall I depict with expert knowledge
416: the cabinet behind the door
417: where the prize-boy of fashion's college
418: is dressed, undressed, and dressed once more?
419: Whatever for caprice of spending
420: ingenious London has been sending
421: across the Baltic in exchange
422: for wood and tallow; all the range
423: of useful objects that the curious
424: Parisian taste invents for one --
425: for friends of languor, or of fun,
426: or for the modishly luxurious --
427: all this, at eighteen years of age,
428: adorned the sanctum of our sage.
429: XXIV
430: Porcelain and bronzes on the table,
431: with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
432: such crystalled scents as best are able
433: to drive the swooning senses mad;
434: with combs, and steel utensils serving
435: as files, and scissors straight and curving,
436: brushes on thirty different scales;
437: brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
438: Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
439: could not conceive how solemn Grimm13
440: dared clean his nails in front of him,
441: the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
442: shows freedom's advocate, that strong
443: champion of rights, as in the wrong.
444: {45}
445: XXV
446: A man who's active and incisive
447: can yet keep nail-care much in mind:
448: why fight what's known to be decisive?
449: custom is despot of mankind.
450: Dressed like -- --,14 duly dreading
451: the barbs that envy's always spreading,
452: Eugene's a pedant in his dress,
453: in fact a thorough fop, no less.
454: Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
455: he'll spend before the looking-glass,
456: then from his cabinet he'll pass
457: giddy as Venus when she's mounting
458: a masculine disguise to aid
459: her progress at the masquerade.
460: XXVI
461: Your curiosity is burning
462: to hear what latest modes require,
463: and so, before the world of learning,
464: I could describe here his attire;
465: and though to do so would be daring,
466: it's my profession; he was wearing --
467: but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
468: these words are not of Russian stock:
469: I know (and seek your exculpation)
470: that even so my wretched style
471: already tends too much to smile
472: on words of foreign derivation,
473: though years ago I used to look
474: at the Academic Diction-book.
475: {46}
476: XXVII
477: That isn't our immediate worry:
478: we'd better hasten to the ball,
479: where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
480: Onegin has outrun us all.
481: Along the fronts of darkened houses,
482: along the street where slumber drowses,
483: twin lamps of serried coupés throw
484: a cheerful glimmer on the snow
485: and radiate a rainbow: blazing
486: with lampions studded all about
487: the sumptuous palais shines out;
488: shadows that flit behind the glazing
489: project in silhouette the tops
490: of ladies and of freakish fops.
491: XXVIII
492: Up to the porch our hero's driven:
493: in, past concierge, up marble stair
494: flown like an arrow, then he's given
495: a deft arrangement to his hair,
496: and entered. Ballroom overflowing...
497: and band already tired of blowing,
498: while a mazurka holds the crowd;
499: and everything is cramped and loud;
500: spurs of Chevalier Gardes are clinking,
501: dear ladies' feet fly past like hail,
502: and on their captivating trail
503: incendiary looks are slinking,
504: while roar of violins contrives
505: to drown the hiss of modish wives.
506: {47}
507: XXIX
508: In days of carefree aspirations,
509: the ballroom drove me off my head:
510: the safest place for declarations,
511: and where most surely notes are sped.
512: You husbands, deeply I respect you!
513: I'm at your service to protect you;
514: now pay attention, I beseech,
515: and take due warning from my speech.
516: You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
517: and watch your daughters closer yet,
518: yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
519: or else... or else, may God forfend it!
520: I only write like this, you know,
521: since I stopped sinning years ago.
522: XXX
523: Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
524: I've wasted too much life away!
525: But, did they not corrupt society,
526: I'd still like dances to this day:
527: the atmosphere of youth and madness,
528: the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
529: the ladies' calculated dress;
530: I love their feet -- though I confess
531: that all of Russia can't contribute
532: three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
533: exists for me one special pair!
534: one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
535: though cold I am and sad; in sleep
536: the heartache that they bring lies deep.
537: {48}
538: XXXI
539: Oh, when, and to what desert banished,
540: madman, can you forget their print?
541: my little feet, where have you vanished,
542: what flowers of spring display your dint?
543: Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
544: across our snows of northern bleakness
545: you left no steps that could be tracked:
546: you loved the opulent contact
547: of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
548: Was it for you that I became
549: long since unstirred by praise and fame
550: and fatherland and grim confinement?
551: The happiness of youth is dead,
552: just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
553: XXXII
554: Diana's breast, the cheeks of Flora,
555: all these are charming! but to put
556: it frankly, I'm a firm adorer
557: of the Terpsichorean foot.
558: It fascinates by its assurance
559: of recompense beyond endurance,
560: and fastens, like a term of art,
561: the wilful fancies of the heart.
562: My love for it is just as tender,
563: under the table's linen shield,
564: on springtime grasses of the field,
565: in winter, on the cast-iron fender,
566: on ballroom's looking-glass parquet
567: or on the granite of the bay.
568: {49}
569: XXXIII
570: On the seashore, with storm impending,
571: how envious was I of the waves
572: each in tumultuous turn descending
573: to lie down at her feet like slaves!
574: I longed, like every breaker hissing,
575: to smother her dear feet with kissing.
576: No, never in the hottest fire
577: of boiling youth did I desire
578: with any torture so exquisite
579: to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
580: the flaming roses of a cheek,
581: or languid bosoms; and no visit
582: of raging passion's surge and roll
583: ever so roughly rocked my soul!
584: XXXIV
585: Another page of recollection:
586: sometimes, in reverie's sacred land,
587: I grasp a stirrup with affection,
588: I feel a small foot in my hand;
589: fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
590: once more that touch is fiercely troubling
591: the blood within my withered heart,
592: once more the love, once more the smart...
593: But, now I've praised the queens of fashion,
594: enough of my loquacious lyre:
595: they don't deserve what they inspire
596: in terms of poetry or passion --
597: their looks and language in deceit
598: are just as nimble as their feet.
599: {50}
600: XXXV
601: And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
602: from ball to bed behold him come;
603: while Petersburg's already rousing,
604: untirable, at sound of drum:
605: the merchant's up, the cabman's walking
606: towards his stall, the pedlar's hawking;
607: see with their jugs the milk-girls go
608: and crisply crunch the morning snow.
609: The city's early sounds awake her;
610: shutters are opened and the soft
611: blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
612: and more than once the German baker,
613: punctilious in his cotton cap,
614: has opened up his serving-trap.
615: XXXVI
616: Exhausted by the ballroom's clamour,
617: converting morning to midnight,
618: he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
619: this child of luxury and delight.
620: Then, after midday he'll be waking;
621: his life till dawn's already making,
622: always monotonously gay,
623: tomorrow just like yesterday.
624: But was it happy, his employment,
625: his freedom, in his youth's first flower,
626: with brilliant conquests by the shower,
627: and every day its own enjoyment?
628: Was it to no effect that he,
629: at feasts, was strong and fancy-free?
630: {51}
631: XXXVII
632: No, early on his heart was cooling
633: and he was bored with social noise;
634: no, not for long were belles the ruling
635: objective of his thoughts and joys:
636: soon, infidelity proved cloying,
637: and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;
638: not every day could he wash down
639: his beefsteak with champagne, or drown
640: his Strasbourg pie, or point a moral,
641: full of his usual pith and wit,
642: with cranium aching fit to split;
643: and though he liked a fiery quarrel --
644: yet he fell out of love at last
645: with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
646: XXXVIII
647: The illness with which he'd been smitten
648: should have been analysed when caught,
649: something like spleen, that scourge of Britain,
650: or Russia's chondria, for short;
651: it mastered him in slow gradation;
652: thank God, he had no inclination
653: to blow his brains out, but in stead
654: to life grew colder than the dead.
655: So, like Childe Harold, glum, unpleasing,
656: he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
657: from Boston's cloth or gossip's quote;
658: no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
659: no, nothing caused his heart to stir,
660: and nothing pierced his senses' blur.
661: {52}
662: (XXXIX, XL, XLI,) XLII
663: Capricious belles of grand Society!
664: you were the first ones he forswore;
665: for in our time, beyond dubiety,
666: the highest circles are a bore.
667: It's true, I'll not misrepresent them,
668: some ladies preach from Say and Bentham,
669: but by and large their talk's a hash
670: of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
671: And what's more, they're so supercilious,
672: so pure, so spotless through and through,
673: so pious, and so clever too,
674: so circumspect, and so punctilious,
675: so virtuous that, no sooner seen,
676: at once they give a man the spleen.
677: XLIII
678: You too, prime beauties in your flower
679: who late at night are whirled away
680: by drozhkies jaunting at full power
681: over the Petersburg pavé --
682: he ended even your employment;
683: and in retreat from all enjoyment
684: locked himself up inside his den
685: and with a yawn took up his pen,
686: and tried to write, but a hard session
687: of work made him feel sick, and still
688: no word came flowing from his quill;
689: he failed to join that sharp profession
690: which I myself won't praise or blame
691: since I'm a member of the same.
692: {53}
693: XLIV
694: Idle again by dedication,
695: oppressed by emptiness of soul,
696: he strove to achieve the appropriation
697: of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
698: with shelves of books deployed for action,
699: he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
700: here's boredom, madness or pretence,
701: here there's no conscience, here no sense;
702: they're all chained up in different fetters,
703: the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
704: the moderns rage against the old.
705: He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
706: and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack
707: in taffeta of mourning black.
708: XLV
709: Escaped from social rhyme and reason,
710: retired, as he, from fashion's stream,
711: I was Onegin's friend that season.
712: I liked his quality, the dream
713: which held him silently subjected,
714: his strangeness, wholly unaffected,
715: his mind, so cold and so precise.
716: The bitterness was mine -- the ice
717: was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
718: our lives were flat, and what had fired
719: both hearts to blaze had now expired;
720: there waited for us both the malice
721: of blind Fortuna and of men
722: in lives that were just dawning then.
723: {54}
724: XLVI
725: He who has lived and thought is certain
726: to scorn the men with whom he deals;
727: days that are lost behind the curtain,
728: ghostlike, must trouble him who feels --
729: for him all sham has found rejection,
730: he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
731: and by Repentance. All this lends,
732: on most occasions between friends,
733: a great attraction to conversing.
734: At first Onegin's tongue produced
735: a haze in me, but I grew used
736: to his disputing and his cursing;
737: his virulence that made you smile,
738: his epigrams topped up with bile.
739: XLVII
740: How often, when the sky was glowing,
741: by Neva, on a summer night,
742: and when its waters were not showing,
743: in their gay glass, the borrowed light
744: of Dian's visage, in our fancies
745: recalling earlier time's romances,
746: recalling earlier loves, did we,
747: now sensitive, and now carefree,
748: drink in the midnight benediction,
749: the silence when our talk had ceased!
750: Like convicts in a dream released
751: from gaol to greenwood, by such fiction
752: we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
753: to the beginning of our days.
754: {55}
755: XLVIII
756: Evgeny stood, with soul regretful,
757: and leant upon the granite shelf;
758: he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
759: just as the Poet15 paints himself.
760: Silence was everywhere enthralling;
761: just sentries to each other calling,
762: and then a drozhky's clopping sound
763: from Million Street16 came floating round;
764: and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
765: swam on the river's dreaming face,
766: and then, with an enchanting grace,
767: came distant horns, and gallant singing.
768: Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
769: the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
770: XLIX
771: O Adrian waves, my invocation;
772: O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
773: hear, once more filled with inspiration,
774: the magic voices of your stream,
775: sacred to children of Apollo!
776: Proud Albion's lyre is what I follow,
777: through it they're known to me, and kin.
778: Italian nights, when I'll drink in
779: your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
780: with a Venetian maiden who
781: can chatter, and be silent too,
782: I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
783: from her my lips will learn and mark
784: the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
785: {56}
786: L
787: When comes my moment to untether?
788: ``it's time!'' and freedom hears my hail.
789: I walk the shore,17 I watch the weather,
790: I signal to each passing sail.
791: Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
792: battling along that watery freeway,
793: when shall I start on my escape?
794: It's time to drop astern the shape
795: of the dull shores of my disfavour,
796: and there, beneath your noonday sky,
797: my Africa,18 where waves break high,
798: to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
799: land where I learned to love and weep,
800: land where my heart is buried deep.
801: LI
802: Eugene would willingly have started
803: with me to see an alien strand;
804: but soon the ways we trod were parted
805: for quite a while by fortune's hand.
806: His father died; and (as expected)
807: before Onegin there collected
808: the usurers' voracious tribe.
809: To private tastes we each subscribe:
810: Evgeny, hating litigation,
811: and satisfied with what he'd got,
812: made over to them his whole lot,
813: finding in that no deprivation --
814: or else, from far off, he could see
815: old Uncle's end was soon to be.
816: {57}
817: LII
818: In fact one day a note came flying
819: from the agent, with this tale to tell:
820: Uncle, in bed, and near to dying,
821: wished him to come and say farewell.
822: Evgeny read the sad epistle
823: and set off prompter than a whistle
824: as fast as post-horses could go,
825: already yawned before the show,
826: exercised, under lucre's banner,
827: in sighs and boredom and deceits
828: (my tale's beginning here repeats);
829: but, when he'd rushed to Uncle's manor,
830: a corpse on boards was all he found,
831: an offering ready for the ground.
832: LIII
833: The yard was bursting with dependants;
834: there gathered at the coffin-side
835: friends, foes, priests, guests, inured attendants
836: of every funeral far and wide;
837: they buried Uncle, congregated
838: to eat and drink, then separated
839: with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
840: as if some goal had been achieved.
841: Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
842: the total ownership of woods,
843: mills, lands and waters -- he whose goods
844: till then had been dispersed and wasted --
845: and glad he was he'd thus arranged
846: for his old courses to be changed.
847: {58}
848: LIV
849: It all seemed new -- for two days only --
850: the coolness of the sombre glade,
851: the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
852: the murmur where the streamlet played...
853: the third day, wood and hill and grazing
854: gripped him no more; soon they were raising
855: an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
856: he saw that, as in cities, here
857: boredom has just as sure an entry,
858: although there are no streets, no cards,
859: no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.
860: Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
861: and dutifully shared his life
862: just like a shadow, or a wife.
863: LV
864: No, I was born for peace abounding
865: and country stillness: there the lyre
866: has voices that are more resounding,
867: poetic dreams, a brighter fire.
868: To harmless idleness devoted,
869: on waves of far niente floated,
870: I roam by the secluded lake.
871: And every morning I awake
872: to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
873: sleep much, read little, and put down
874: the thought of volatile renown.
875: Was it not in such sweet employment
876: such shadowy and leisured ways,
877: that once I spent my happiest days?
878: {59}
879: LVI
880: O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
881: o fields -- to you I'm vowed at heart.
882: I regularly take much pleasure
883: in showing how to tell apart
884: myself and Eugene, lest a reader
885: of mocking turn, or else a breeder
886: of calculated slander should,
887: spying my features, as he could,
888: put back the libel on the table
889: that, like proud Byron, I can draw
890: self-portraits only -- furthermore
891: the charge that poets are unable
892: to sing of others must imply
893: the poet's only theme is ``I.''
894: LVII
895: Poets, I'll say in this connection,
896: adore the love that comes in dream.
897: In time past, objects of affection
898: peopled my sleep, and to their theme
899: my soul in secret gave survival;
900: then from the Muse there came revival:
901: my carefree song would thus reveal
902: the mountain maiden,19 my ideal,
903: and captive girls, by Salgir20 lying.
904: And now, my friends, I hear from you
905: a frequent question: ``tell me who
906: inspires your lute to sounds of sighing?
907: To whom do you, from all the train
908: of jealous girls, devote its strain?
909: {60}
910: LVIII
911: ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
912: rewards the music of your mind
913: with fond caress? whose adoration
914: is in your poetry enshrined?''
915: No one's, I swear by God! in sadness
916: I suffered once from all the madness
917: of love's anxiety. Blessed is he
918: who can combine it with the free
919: fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
920: poetry's sacred frenzy, made
921: a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
922: the pangs with which his heart was troubled,
923: and, with it, forced renown to come --
924: but I, in love, was dull and dumb.
925: LIX
926: Love passed, the Muse appeared, the weather
927: of mind got clarity new-found;
928: now free, I once more weave together
929: emotion, thought, and magic sound;
930: I write, my heart has ceased its pining,
931: my thoughtless pen has stopped designing,
932: beside unfinished lines, a suite
933: of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
934: dead ash sets no more sparks a-flying;
935: I'm grieving still, but no more tears,
936: and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
937: will in my soul be hushed and dying.
938: That's when I'll sit down to compose
939: an ode in twenty-five cantos.
940: {61}
941: LX
942: I've drawn a plan and a projection,
943: the hero's name's decided too.
944: Meanwhile my novel's opening section
945: is finished, and I've looked it through
946: meticulously; in my fiction
947: there's far too much of contradiction,
948: but I refuse to chop or change.
949: The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
950: I'll feed the journalists for dinner
951: fruits of my labour and my ink...
952: So now be off to Neva's brink,
953: you newborn work, and like a winner
954: earn for me the rewards of fame --
955: misunderstanding, noise, and blame!
956: {62}

983: --------
984: Chapter Two
985: O rus!
986: Horace
987: O Russia!
988: I
989: The place where Eugene loathed his leisure
990: was an enchanting country nook:
991: there any friend of harmless pleasure
992: would bless the form his fortune took.
993: The manor house, in deep seclusion,
994: screened by a hill from storm's intrusion,
995: looked on a river: far away
996: before it was the golden play
997: of light that flowering fields reflected:
998: villages flickered far and near,
999: and cattle roamed the plain, and here
1000: a park, enormous and neglected,
1001: spread out its shadow all around --
1002: the pensive Dryads' hiding-ground.
1003: {63}
1004: II
1005: The château was of a construction
1006: befitting such a noble pile:
1007: it stood, defiant of destruction
1008: in sensible old-fashioned style.
1009: High ceilings everywhere abounded;
1010: in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,
1011: ancestral1 portraits met the view
1012: and stoves with tiles of various hue.
1013: All this has now gone out of fashion,
1014: I don't know why, but for my friend
1015: interior décor in the end
1016: excited not a hint of passion:
1017: a modish taste, a dowdy touch --
1018: both set him yawning just as much.
1019: III
1020: The rustic sage, in that apartment,
1021: forty years long would criticise
1022: his housekeeper and her department
1023: look through the pane, and squash the flies.
1024: Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
1025: two cupboards, one divan, a table,
1026: no trace of ink, no spots, no stains.
1027: And of the cupboards, one contains
1028: a book of household calculations,
1029: the other, jugs of applejack,
1030: fruit liqueurs and an Almanack
1031: for 1808: his obligations
1032: had left the squire no time to look
1033: at any other sort of book.
1034: {64}
1035: IV
1036: Alone amid all his possessions,
1037: to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
1038: it led him, in these early sessions,
1039: to institute a new regime.
1040: A thinker in a desert mission,
1041: he changed the corvée of tradition
1042: into a small quit-rent -- and got
1043: his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
1044: But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
1045: neighbour was sure, from this would flow
1046: consequences of hideous woe;
1047: another's grin was sly and shifty,
1048: but all concurred that, truth to speak,
1049: he was a menace, and a freak.
1050: V
1051: At first they called; but on perceiving
1052: invariably, as time went on,
1053: that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
1054: on a fast stallion from the Don,
1055: once on the highway he'd detected
1056: the noise their rustic wheels projected --
1057: they took offence at this, and broke
1058: relations off, and never spoke.
1059: ``The man's a boor; his brain is missing,
1060: he's a freemason too; for him,
1061: red wine in tumblers to the brim --
1062: but ladies' hands are not for kissing;
1063: it's yes or no, but never sir.''
1064: The vote was passed without demur.
1065: {65}
1066: VI
1067: Meanwhile another new landowner
1068: came driving to his country seat,
1069: and, in the district, this persona
1070: drew scrutiny no less complete --
1071: Vladimir Lensky, whose creator
1072: was Göttingen, his alma mater,
1073: good-looking, in the flower of age,
1074: a poet, and a Kantian sage.
1075: He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
1076: from German realms of mist and steam,
1077: freedom's enthusiastic dream,
1078: a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
1079: an eloquence of fevered strength,
1080: and raven curls of shoulder-length.
1081: VII
1082: He was too young to have been blighted
1083: by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
1084: his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
1085: at a friend's word, a girl's caress.
1086: In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,
1087: he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
1088: the world's éclat, its thunder-roll,
1089: still captivated his young soul.
1090: He sweetened up with fancy's icing
1091: the uncertainties within his heart;
1092: for him, the objective on life's chart
1093: was still mysterious and enticing --
1094: something to rack his brains about,
1095: suspecting wonders would come out.
1096: {66}
1097: VIII
1098: He was convinced, a kindred creature
1099: would be allied to him by fate;
1100: that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
1101: from day to day she could but wait;
1102: and he believed his friends were ready
1103: to put on chains for him, and steady
1104: their hand to grapple slander's cup,
1105: in his defence, and smash it up;
1106: < that there existed, for the indulgence
1107: of human friendship, holy men,
1108: immortals picked by fate for when,
1109: with irresistible refulgence,
1110: their breed would (some years after this)
1111: shine out and bring the world to bliss. >2
1112: IX
1113: Compassion, yes, and indignation,
1114: honest devotion to the good,
1115: bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
1116: already stirred him as they should.
1117: He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
1118: Schiller and Goethe had refined him,
1119: and theirs was the poetic flame
1120: that fired his soul, to burn the same;
1121: the Muses' lofty arts and fashions,
1122: fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;
1123: but in his songs kept pride of place
1124: for the sublime, and for the passions
1125: of virgin fancy, and again
1126: the charm of what was grave and plain.
1127: {67}
1128: X
1129: He sang of love, to love subjected,
1130: his song was limpid in its tune
1131: as infant sleep, or the unaffected
1132: thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
1133: through heaven's expanse serenely flying,
1134: that queen of secrets and of sighing.
1135: He sang of grief and parting-time,
1136: of something vague, some misty clime;
1137: roses romantically blowing;
1138: of many distant lands he sang
1139: where in the heart of silence rang
1140: his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
1141: he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --
1142: when not quite eighteen years of age.
1143: XI
1144: But in that desert his attainments
1145: only to Eugene showed their worth;
1146: Lensky disliked the entertainments
1147: of neighbouring owners of the earth --
1148: he fled from their resounding chatter!
1149: Their talk, so sound on every matter,
1150: on liquor, and on hay brought in,
1151: on kennels, and on kith and kin,
1152: it had no sparkle of sensation,
1153: it lacked, of course, poetic heart,
1154: sharpness of wit, and social art,
1155: and logic; yet the conversation
1156: upon the side of the distaff --
1157: that was less clever still by half.
1158: {68}
1159: XII
1160: Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
1161: was asked around as quite a catch --
1162: such is the usual country cooking;
1163: and all the neighbours planned a match
1164: between their girls and this half-Russian.
1165: As soon as he appears, discussion
1166: touches obliquely, but with speed,
1167: on the dull life that bachelors lead;
1168: and then it's tea that comes to mention,
1169: and Dunya works the samovar;
1170: and soon they bring her... a guitar
1171: and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
1172: then, help me God, she caterwauls:
1173: ``Come to me in my golden halls.''
1174: XIII
1175: Lensky of course was quite untainted
1176: by any itch for marriage ties;
1177: instead the chance to get acquainted
1178: with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
1179: So, verse and prose, they came together.
1180: No ice and flame, no stormy weather
1181: and granite, were so far apart.
1182: At first, disparity of heart
1183: rendered them tedious to each other;
1184: then liking grew, then every day
1185: they met on horseback; quickly they
1186: became like brother knit to brother.
1187: Friendship, as I must own to you,
1188: blooms when there's nothing else to do.
1189: {69}
1190: XIV
1191: But friendship, as between our heroes,
1192: can't really be: for we've outgrown
1193: old prejudice; all men are zeros,
1194: the units are ourselves alone.
1195: Napoleon's our sole inspiration;
1196: the millions of two-legged creation
1197: for us are instruments and tools;
1198: feeling is quaint, and fit for fools.
1199: More tolerant in his conception
1200: than most. Evgeny, though he knew
1201: and scorned his fellows through and through,
1202: yet, as each rule has its exception,
1203: people there were he glorified,
1204: feelings he valued -- from outside.
1205: XV
1206: He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
1207: perfervid language of the bard,
1208: his mind, in judgement still unsteady,
1209: and always the inspired regard --
1210: to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
1211: he struggled to bite back the chilling
1212: word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
1213: folly for me to interfere
1214: with such a blissful, brief infection --
1215: even without me it will sink;
1216: but meanwhile let him live, and think
1217: the universe is all perfection;
1218: youth is a fever; we must spare
1219: its natural right to rave and flare.
1220: {70}
1221: XVI
1222: Between them, every topic started
1223: reflection or provoked dispute:
1224: treaties of nations long departed,
1225: and good and ill, and learning's fruit,
1226: the prejudices of the ages,
1227: the secrets of the grave, the pages
1228: of fate, and life, each in its turn
1229: became their scrutiny's concern.
1230: In the white heat of some dissension
1231: the abstracted poet would bring forth
1232: fragments of poems from the North,
1233: which, listening with some condescension,
1234: the tolerant Evgeny heard --
1235: but scarcely understood a word.
1236: XVII
1237: But it was passion that preempted
1238: the thoughts of my two anchorites.
1239: From that rough spell at last exempted,
1240: Onegin spoke about its flights
1241: with sighs unconsciously regretful.
1242: Happy is he who's known its fretful
1243: empire, and fled it; happier still
1244: is he who's never felt its will,
1245: he who has cooled down love with parting,
1246: and hate with malice; he whose life
1247: is yawned away with friends and wife
1248: untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
1249: who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
1250: has never staked his family seat.
1251: {71}
1252: XVIII
1253: When we've retreated to the banner
1254: of calm and reason, when the flame
1255: of passion's out, and its whole manner
1256: become a joke to us, its game,
1257: its wayward tricks, its violent surging,
1258: its echoes, its belated urging,
1259: reduced to sense, not without pain --
1260: we sometimes like to hear again
1261: passion's rough language talked by others,
1262: and feel once more emotion's ban.
1263: So a disabled soldier-man,
1264: retired, forgotten by his brothers,
1265: in his small shack, will listen well
1266: to tales that young moustachios tell.
1267: XIX
1268: But it's the talent for concealing
1269: that ardent youth entirely lacks;
1270: hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,
1271: it blabs, and spills them in its tracks.
1272: As, lovingly, in his confession,
1273: the poet's heart found full expression,
1274: Eugene, with solemn face, paid heed,
1275: and felt himself love's invalide.
1276: Lensky ingenuously related
1277: his conscience's record, and so
1278: Onegin swiftly came to know
1279: his tale of youthful love, narrated
1280: with deep emotion through and through,
1281: to us, though, not exactly new.
1282: {72}
1283: XX
1284: Ah, he had loved a love that never
1285: is known today; only a soul
1286: that raves with poetry can ever
1287: be doomed to feel it: there's one goal
1288: perpetually, one goal for dreaming,
1289: one customary object gleaming,
1290: one customary grief each hour!
1291: not separation's chilling power,
1292: no years of absence past returning,
1293: no beauties of a foreign clime,
1294: no noise of gaiety, no time
1295: devoted to the Muse, or learning,
1296: nothing could alter or could tire
1297: this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
1298: XXI
1299: Since earliest boyhood he had doted
1300: on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
1301: with tenderness he'd watched and noted
1302: her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
1303: by deep and shady woods protected;
1304: the crown of marriage was projected
1305: for them by fathers who, as friends
1306: and neighbours, followed the same ends.
1307: Away inside that unassuming
1308: homestead, before her parents' gaze,
1309: she blossomed in the graceful ways
1310: of innocence: a lily blooming
1311: in deepest grasses, quite alone,
1312: to bee and butterfly unknown.
1313: {73}
1314: XXII
1315: And our young poet -- Olga fired him
1316: in his first dream of passion's fruit,
1317: and thoughts of her were what inspired him
1318: to the first meanings of his flute.
1319: Farewell the games of golden childhood!
1320: he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
1321: solitude, stillness and the night,
1322: the stars, the moon -- celestial light
1323: to which so oft we've dedicated
1324: those walks amid the gloom and calm
1325: of evening, and those tears, the balm
1326: of secret pain... but it's now rated
1327: by judgement of the modern camp
1328: almost as good as a dim lamp.
1329: XXIII
1330: Full of obedience and demureness,
1331: as gay as morning and as clear,
1332: poetic in her simple pureness,
1333: sweet as a lover's kiss, and dear,
1334: in Olga everything expresses --
1335: the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
1336: smile, voice and movements, little waist --
1337: take any novel, clearly traced
1338: you're sure to find her portrait in it:
1339: a portrait with a charming touch;
1340: once I too liked it very much;
1341: but now it bores me every minute.
1342: Reader, the elder sister now
1343: must be my theme, if you'll allow.
1344: {74}
1345: XXIV
1346: Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
1347: self-willed it may be just the same;
1348: but it's the first time you'll have known it,
1349: a novel graced with such a name.
1350: What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
1351: and yet inseparably present,
1352: I know it, in the thoughts of all
1353: are old times, and the servants' hall.
1354: We must confess that taste deserts us
1355: even in our names (and how much worse
1356: when we begin to talk of verse);
1357: culture, so far from healing, hurts us;
1358: what it's transported to our shore
1359: is mincing manners -- nothing more.
1360: XXV
1361: So she was called Tatyana. Truly
1362: she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
1363: the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
1364: to catch the eye and to attract.
1365: Shy as a savage, silent, tearful,
1366: wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
1367: Tatyana had a changeling look
1368: in her own home. She never took
1369: to kissing or caressing father
1370: or mother; and in all the play
1371: of children, though as young as they,
1372: she never joined, or skipped, but rather
1373: in silence all day she'd remain
1374: ensconced beside the window-pane.
1375: {75}
1376: XXVI
1377: Reflection was her friend and pleasure
1378: right from the cradle of her days;
1379: it touched with reverie her leisure,
1380: adorning all its country ways.
1381: Her tender touch had never fingered
1382: the needle, never had she lingered
1383: to liven with a silk atour
1384: the linen stretched on the tambour.
1385: Sign of the urge for domination:
1386: in play with her obedient doll
1387: the child prepares for protocol --
1388: that corps of social legislation --
1389: and to it, with a grave import,
1390: repeats what her mama has taught.
1391: XXVII
1392: Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
1393: not even in her earliest age;
1394: she'd never tell them news or scandal
1395: or novelties from fashion's page.
1396: Tatyana never knew the attraction
1397: of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
1398: to horror-stories told at night
1399: in winter was her heart's delight.
1400: Whenever nyanya had collected
1401: for Olga, on the spreading lawn,
1402: her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
1403: she'd never join the game selected,
1404: for she was bored by laughs and noise
1405: and by the sound of silly joys.
1406: {76}
1407: XXVIII
1408: She loved the balcony, the session
1409: of waiting for the dawn to blush,
1410: when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
1411: fades from the view, and in the hush
1412: earth's rim grows light, and a forewarning
1413: whisper of breeze announces morning,
1414: and slowly day begins to climb.
1415: In winter, when for longer time
1416: the shades of night within their keeping
1417: hold half the world still unreleased,
1418: and when, by misty moon, the east
1419: is softly, indolently sleeping,
1420: wakened at the same hour of night
1421: Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.
1422: XXIX
1423: From early on she loved romances,
1424: they were her only food... and so
1425: she fell in love with all the fancies
1426: of Richardson and of Rousseau.
1427: Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
1428: but in an earlier age retarded,
1429: could see no harm in books; himself
1430: he never took one from the shelf,
1431: thought them a pointless peccadillo;
1432: and cared not what his daughter kept
1433: by way of secret tome that slept
1434: until the dawn beneath her pillow.
1435: His wife, just like Tatyana, had
1436: on Richardson gone raving mad.
1437: {77}
1438: XXX
1439: And not because she'd read him, either,
1440: and not because she'd once preferred
1441: Lovelace, or Grandison, or neither;
1442: but in the old days she had heard
1443: about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
1444: so often from her Moscow cousin
1445: Princess Alina. She was still
1446: engaged then -- but against her will;
1447: loved someone else, not her intended,
1448: someone towards whose heart and mind
1449: her feelings were far more inclined --
1450: this Grandison of hers was splendid,
1451: a fop, a punter on the cards,
1452: and junior Ensign in the Guards.
1453: XXXI
1454: She was like him and always sported
1455: the latest fashions of the town;
1456: but, without asking, they transported
1457: her to the altar and the crown.
1458: The better to dispel her sorrow
1459: her clever husband on the morrow
1460: took her to his estate, where she,
1461: at first, with God knows whom to see,
1462: in tears and violent tossing vented
1463: her grief, and nearly ran away.
1464: Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
1465: she grew accustomed, and contented.
1466: In stead of happiness, say I,
1467: custom's bestowed us from on high.
1468: {78}
1469: XXXII
1470: For it was custom that consoled her
1471: in grief that nothing else could mend;
1472: soon a great truth came to enfold her
1473: and give her comfort to the end:
1474: she found, in labours and in leisure,
1475: the secret of her husband's measure,
1476: and ruled him like an autocrat --
1477: so all went smoothly after that.
1478: Mushrooms in brine, for winter eating,
1479: fieldwork directed from the path,
1480: accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
1481: meantime she'd give the maids a beating
1482: if her cross mood was at its worst --
1483: but never asked her husband first.
1484: XXXIII
1485: No, soon she changed her old demeanour:
1486: girls' albums, signed in blood for choice;
1487: Praskovya re-baptized ``Polina'';
1488: conversing in a singsong voice;
1489: lacing her stays up very tightly;
1490: pronouncing through her nose politely
1491: the Russian N, like N in French;
1492: soon all that went without a wrench:
1493: album and stays, Princess Alina,
1494: sentiment, notebook, verses, all
1495: she quite forgot -- began to call
1496: ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,
1497: and introduced, for the last lap,
1498: a quilted chamber-robe and cap.
1499: {79}
1500: XXXIV
1501: Her loving spouse with approbation
1502: left her to follow her own line,
1503: trusted her without hesitation,
1504: and wore his dressing-gown to dine.
1505: His life went sailing in calm weather;
1506: sometimes the evening brought together
1507: neighbours and friends in kindly group,
1508: a plain, unceremonious troop,
1509: for grumbling, gossiping and swearing
1510: and for a chuckle or a smile.
1511: The evening passes, and meanwhile
1512: here's tea that Olga's been preparing;
1513: after that, supper's served, and so
1514: bed-time, and time for guests to go.
1515: XXXV
1516: Throughout their life, so calm, so peaceful,
1517: sweet old tradition was preserved:
1518: for them, in Butterweek5 the greaseful,
1519: Russian pancakes were always served;
1520: < ...
1521: ... >2
1522: they needed kvas like air; at table
1523: their guests, for all they ate and drank,
1524: were served in order of their rank.
1525: {80}
1526: XXXVI
1527: And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
1528: till he at last was summoned down
1529: into the tomb's wide open portals,
1530: and once again received a crown.
1531: Just before dinner, from his labours
1532: he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
1533: his children and his faithful wife,
1534: far more than most who leave this life.
1535: He was a good and simple barin;6
1536: above the dust of his remains
1537: the funeral monument explains:
1538: ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
1539: beneath the stone reposes here,
1540: servant of God, and Brigadier.''
1541: XXXVII
1542: Lensky, restored to his manorial
1543: penates, came to cast an eye
1544: over his neighbour's plain memorial,
1545: and offer to that ash a sigh;
1546: sadly he mourned for the departed.
1547: ``Poor Yorick,'' said he, broken-hearted:
1548: ``he dandled me as a small boy.
1549: How many times I made a toy
1550: of his Ochákov7 decoration!
1551: He destined Olga's hand for me,
1552: kept asking: "shall I live to see"...''
1553: so, full of heart-felt tribulation,
1554: Lensky composed in autograph
1555: a madrigal for epitaph.
1556: {81}
1557: XXXVIII
1558: There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
1559: his parents' patriarchal dust
1560: with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
1561: Alas! the generations must,
1562: as fate's mysterious purpose burrows,
1563: reap a brief harvest on their furrows;
1564: they rise and ripen and fall dead:
1565: others will follow where they tread...
1566: and thus our race, so fluctuating,
1567: grows, surges, boils, for lack of room
1568: presses its forebears to the tomb.
1569: We too shall find our hour is waiting;
1570: it will be our descendants who
1571: out of this world will crowd us too.
1572: XXXIX
1573: So glut yourselves until you're sated
1574: on this unstable life, my friends!
1575: its nullity I've always hated,
1576: I know too surely how it ends.
1577: I'm blind to every apparition;
1578: and yet a distant admonition
1579: of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;
1580: it would be painful to depart
1581: and leave no faint footprint of glory...
1582: I never lived or wrote for praise;
1583: yet how I wish that I might raise
1584: to high renown my doleful story,
1585: that there be just one voice which came,
1586: like a true friend, to speak my name.
1587: {82}
1588: XL
1589: And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
1590: for maybe fortune will have saved
1591: from drowning's death in Lethe river
1592: the strophe over which I slaved;
1593: perhaps -- for flattering hope will linger --
1594: some future dunce will point a finger
1595: at my famed portrait and will say:
1596: he was a poet in his day.
1597: I thank him without reservation,
1598: the peaceful Muses' devotee,
1599: whose memory will preserve for me
1600: the fleeting works of my creation,
1601: whose kindly hand will ruffle down
1602: the laurel in the old man's crown!
1603: {83}
1604: Notes to Chapter Two
1605: 1 Pushkin first wrote ``imperial portraits''; but this he later altered
1606: ``for reasons of censorship'' because, as Nabokov explains, ``tsars were not
1607: to be mentioned in so offhand a way''.
1608: 2 Lines discarded by Pushkin.
1609: 3  ``Sweet-sounding Greek names like  Agathon... etc., are only current
1610: in Russia among the common people.'' Pushkin's note.
1611: 4 Serfs chosen as recruits for the army had their forelock cut off.
1612: 5 The week before Lent.
1613: 6 Gentleman, squire.
1614: 7 Fortress captured from the Turks in 1788.
1615: --------
1616: Chapter Three
1617: Elle était fille, elle était amoureuse.
1618: Malfilâtre
1619: ``You're off? why, there's a poet for you!''
1620: ``Goodbye, Onegin, time I went.''
1621: ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;
1622: but where are all your evenings spent?''
1623: ``At the Larins'!'' ``But how mysterious.
1624: For goodness' sake, you can't be serious
1625: killing each evening off like that?''
1626: ``You're wrong.'' ``But what I wonder at
1627: is this -- one sees from here the party:
1628: in first place -- listen, am I right? --
1629: a simple Russian family night:
1630: the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
1631: on jam, and speeches in regard
1632: to rains, and flax, and the stockyard.''
1633: {84}
1634: II
1635: ``I don't see what's so bad about it.''
1636: ``Boredom, that's what so bad, my friend.''
1637: ``Your modish world, I'll do without it;
1638: give me the homely hearth, and lend...''
1639: ``You pile one eclogue on another!
1640: for God's sake, that will do. But, brother,
1641: you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
1642: Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
1643: for me to glimpse this Phyllis ever
1644: with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
1645: pen, tears, and rhymes, and all the rest?
1646: Present me, please.'' ``You're joking.'' ``Never.''
1647: ``Gladly.'' ``So when?'' ``Why not tonight?
1648: They will receive us with delight.''
1649: III
1650: ``Let's go.'' The friends, all haste and vigour,
1651: drive there, and with formality
1652: are treated to the fullest rigour
1653: of old-lime hospitality.
1654: The protocol is all one wishes:
1655: the jams appear in little dishes;
1656: on a small table's oilcloth sheen
1657: the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1
1658: {85}
1659: IV
1660: And home was now their destination;
1661: as by the shortest way they flew,
1662: this was our heroes' conversation
1663: secretly overheard by you.
1664: ``You yawn, Onegin?'' ``As I'm used to.''
1665: ``This time I think you've been reduced to
1666: new depths of boredom.'' ``No, the same.
1667: The fields are dark, since evening came.
1668: Drive on, Andryushka! quicker, quicker!
1669: the country's pretty stupid here!
1670: oh, à propos: Larin's a dear
1671: simple old lady; but the liquor --
1672: I'm much afraid that bilberry wine
1673: won't benefit these guts of mine.''
1674: V
1675: ``But tell me, which one was Tatyana?''
1676: ``She was the one who looked as still
1677: and melancholy as Svetlana,2
1678: and sat down by the window-sill.''
1679: ``The one you love's the younger daughter?''
1680: ``Why not?'' ``I'd choose the other quarter
1681: if I, like you, had been a bard.
1682: Olga's no life in her regard:
1683: the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
1684: a pretty girl exactly like
1685: any Madonna by Van Dyck:
1686: a dumb moon, on a dumb horizon.''
1687: Lensky had a curt word to say
1688: and then sat silent all the way.
1689: {86}
1690: VI
1691: Meanwhile the news of Eugene coming
1692: to the Larins' had caused a spout
1693: of gossip, and set comment humming
1694: among the neighbours round about.
1695: Conjecture found unending matter:
1696: there was a general furtive chatter,
1697: and jokes and spiteful gossip ran
1698: claiming Tatyana'd found her man;
1699: and some were even testifying
1700: the marriage plans were all exact
1701: but held up by the simple fact
1702: that modish rings were still a-buying.
1703: Of Lensky's fate they said no more --
1704: they'd settled that some years before.
1705: VII
1706: Tatyana listened with vexation
1707: to all this tattle, yet at heart
1708: in indescribable elation,
1709: despite herself, rehearsed the part:
1710: the thought sank in, and penetrated:
1711: she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
1712: so fires of spring will bring to birth
1713: a seedling fallen in the earth.
1714: Her feelings in their weary session
1715: had long been wasting and enslaved
1716: by pain and languishment; she craved
1717: the fateful diet; by depression
1718: her heart had long been overrun:
1719: her soul was waiting... for someone.
1720: {87}
1721: VIII
1722: Tatyana now need wait no longer.
1723: Her eyes were opened, and she said
1724: ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
1725: in sultry sleep, in lonely bed,
1726: all day, all night, his presence fills her,
1727: by magic everything instils her
1728: with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
1729: She hates a friendly voice's sound,
1730: or servants waiting on her pleasure.
1731: Sunk in dejection, she won't hear
1732: the talk of guests when they appear;
1733: she calls down curses on their leisure,
1734: and, when one's least prepared for it
1735: their tendency to call, and sit.
1736: IX
1737: Now, she devours, with what attention,
1738: delicious novels, laps them up;
1739: and all their ravishing invention
1740: with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
1741: These figures from the world of seeming,
1742: embodied by the power of dreaming,
1743: the lover of Julie Wolmar,3
1744: and Malek Adel,4 de Linar,5
1745: and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
1746: and Grandison beyond compare,
1747: who sets me snoring then and there --
1748: all for our tender dreamy maiden
1749: are coloured in a single tone,
1750: all blend into Eugene alone.
1751: {88}
1752: X
1753: Seeing herself as a creation --
1754: Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine6 --
1755: by writers of her admiration,
1756: Tatyana, lonely heroine,
1757: roamed the still forest like a ranger,
1758: sought in her book, that text of danger
1759: and found her dreams, her secret fire,
1760: the full fruit of her heart's desire;
1761: she sighed, and in a trance coopted
1762: another's joy, another's breast,
1763: whispered by heart a note addressed
1764: to the hero that she'd adopted.
1765: But ours, whatever he might be,
1766: ours was no Grandison -- not he.
1767: XI
1768: Lending his tone a grave inflection,
1769: the ardent author of the past
1770: showed one a pattern of perfection
1771: in which his hero's mould was cast.
1772: He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
1773: wronged always in disgraceful fashion --
1774: a soul of sympathy and grace,
1775: and brains, and an attractive face.
1776: Always our fervid hero tended
1777: pure passion's flame, and in a trice
1778: would launch into self-sacrifice;
1779: always before the volume ended
1780: due punishment was handed down
1781: to vice, while virtue got its crown.
1782: {89}
1783: XII
1784: Today a mental fog enwraps us,
1785: each moral puts us in a doze,
1786: even in novels, vice entraps us,
1787: yes, even there its triumph grows.
1788: Now that the British Muse is able
1789: to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,
1790: the idol that she'll most admire
1791: is either the distrait Vampire,
1792: Melmoth,7 whose roaming never ceases,
1793: Sbogar,8 mysterious through and through,
1794: the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
1795: Lord Byron, with his shrewd caprices,
1796: dressed up a desperate egoism
1797: to look like sad romanticism.
1798: XIII
1799: In this, dear reader, if you know it,
1800: show me the sense. Divine decree
1801: may wind up my career as poet;
1802: perhaps, though Phoebus warns, I'll see
1803: installed in me a different devil,
1804: and sink to prose's humble level:
1805: a novel on the established line
1806: may then amuse my glad decline.
1807: No secret crimes, and no perditions,
1808: shall make my story grim as hell;
1809: no, quite naively I'll retell
1810: a Russian family's old traditions;
1811: love's melting dreams shall fill my rhyme,
1812: and manners of an earlier time.
1813: {90}
1814: XIV
1815: I'll catalogue each simple saying
1816: in father's or old uncle's book,
1817: and tell of children's plighted playing
1818: by ancient limes, or by a brook;
1819: and after jealousy's grim weather
1820: I'll part them, bring them back together;
1821: I'll make them spar another round,
1822: then to the altar, to be crowned.
1823: I'll conjure up that swooning fashion
1824: of ardent speech, that aching flow
1825: of language which, so long ago,
1826: facing a belle I loved with passion,
1827: my tongue kept drawing from the heart --
1828: but now I've rather lost the art.
1829: XV
1830: Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
1831: for you have, at this early date,
1832: into a modish tyrant's keeping
1833: resigned disposal of your fate.
1834: Dear Tanya, you're condemned to perish;
1835: but first, the dreams that hope can cherish
1836: evoke for you a sombre bliss;
1837: you learn life's sweetness, and with this
1838: you drink the magic draught of yearning,
1839: that poison brew; and in your mind
1840: reverie hounds you, and you find
1841: shelter for trysts at every turning;
1842: in front of you, on every hand,
1843: you see your fated tempter stand.
1844: {91}
1845: XVI
1846: Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
1847: has made the park her brooding-place,
1848: suddenly lowering eyes that languish,
1849: too faint to stir a further pace:
1850: her bosom heaves, her cheeks are staring
1851: scarlet with passion's instant flaring,
1852: upon her lips the breathing dies,
1853: noise in her ears, glare in her eyes...
1854: then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
1855: far-distant heaven's vaulted room;
1856: a nightingale, in forest gloom,
1857: sets a sonorous cadence rolling --
1858: Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
1859: makes to her nurse low-voiced remark:
1860: XVII
1861: ``I can't sleep, nyanya: it's so stifling!
1862: open the window, sit down near.''
1863: ``Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.
1864: The olden days, I want to hear...''
1865: ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
1866: years back, to call up many a fable;
1867: I kept in mind an ancient store
1868: of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
1869: but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
1870: now I've forgotten all I knew.
1871: A sorry state of things, it's true!
1872: My mind is fuddled.'' ``Tell me, nyanya,
1873: your early life, unlock your tongue:
1874: were you in love when you were young?''
1875: {92}
1876: XVIII
1877: ``What nonsense, Tanya! in those other
1878: ages we'd never heard of love:
1879: why, at the thought, my husband's mother
1880: had chased me to the world above.''
1881: ``How did you come to marry, nyanya?''
1882: ``I reckon, by God's will. My Vanya
1883: was younger still, but at that stage
1884: I was just thirteen years of age.
1885: Two weeks the matchmaker was plying
1886: to see my kin, and in the end
1887: my father blessed me. So I'd spend
1888: my hours in fear and bitter crying.
1889: Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
1890: and sang me to the altar-mat.
1891: XIX
1892: ``So to strange kinsfolk I was taken...
1893: but you're not paying any heed.''
1894: ``Oh nurse, I'm sad, I'm sad, I'm shaken,
1895: I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
1896: I'm near to sobbing, near to weeping!...''
1897: ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
1898: the Lord have mercy on us all!
1899: whatever you may need, just call...
1900: I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
1901: you're all in fever... heavens above.''
1902: ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''
1903: ``The Lord God be with you, my daughter!''
1904: and, hands a-tremble, Nyanya prayed
1905: and put a cross-sign on the maid.
1906: {93}
1907: XX
1908: ``I am in love,'' Tatyana's wailing
1909: whisper repeated to the crone.
1910: ``My dearest heart, you're sick and ailing.''
1911: ``I am in love; leave me alone.''
1912: And all the while the moon was shining
1913: and with its feeble glow outlining
1914: the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
1915: her drops of tears, and seated there,
1916: in quilted coat, where rays were gleaming
1917: on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
1918: the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
1919: and everything around was dreaming,
1920: in the deep stillness of the night,
1921: bathed in the moon's inspiring light.
1922: XXI
1923: Tatyana watched the moon, and floated
1924: through distant regions of the heart...
1925: A thought was born, and quickly noted...
1926: ``Go, nurse, and leave me here apart.
1927: Give me a pen and give me paper,
1928: bring up a table, and a taper;
1929: good night; I swear I'll lie down soon.''
1930: She was alone, lit by the moon.
1931: Elbow on table, spirit seething,
1932: still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
1933: and in her unconsidered note
1934: all a pure maiden's love was breathing.
1935: She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
1936: Tatyana! it's addressed... to whom?
1937: {94}
1938: XXII
1939: I've known too many a haughty beauty,
1940: cold, pure as ice, and as unkind,
1941: inexorably wed to duty,
1942: unfathomable to the mind;
1943: shocked by their modish pride, and fleeing
1944: the utter virtue of their being,
1945: I've run a mile, I must avow,
1946: having decyphered on their brow
1947: hell's terrifying imprecation:
1948: ``Abandon hope for evermore.''9
1949: Our love is what they most abhor;
1950: our terror is their consolation.
1951: Ladies of such a cast, I think,
1952: you too have seen on Neva's brink.
1953: XXIII
1954: Thronged by adorers, I've detected
1955: another, freakish one, who stays
1956: quite self-absorbed and unaffected
1957: by sighs of passion or by praise.
1958: To my astonishment I've seen her,
1959: having by her severe demeanour
1960: frightened to death a timid love,
1961: revive it with another shove --
1962: at least by a regretful kindness;
1963: at least her tone is sometimes found
1964: more tender than it used to sound.
1965: I've seen how, trustful in his blindness,
1966: the youthful lover once again
1967: runs after what is sweet, and vain.
1968: {95}
1969: XXIV
1970: Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
1971: is it that she, poor simple sweet,
1972: believes in her elected dreaming
1973: and has no knowledge of deceit?
1974: that, artless, and without concealing,
1975: her love obeys the laws of feeling,
1976: that she's so trustful, and imbued
1977: by heaven with such an unsubdued
1978: imagination, with such reason,
1979: such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
1980: and heart so tender, it can still
1981: burst to a fiery blaze in season?
1982: Such feckless passion -- as I live,
1983: is this then what you can't forgive?
1984: XXV
1985: The flirt has reason's cool volition;
1986: Tatyana's love is no by-play,
1987: she yields to it without condition
1988: like a sweet child. She'll never say:
1989: ``By virtue of procrastinating
1990: we'll keep love's price appreciating,
1991: we'll draw it deeper in our net;
1992: first, we'll take vanity, and let
1993: hope sting it, then we'll try deploying
1994: doubts, to exhaust the heart, then fire
1995: jealousy's flame, to light desire;
1996: else, having found his pleasure cloying,
1997: the cunning prisoner can quite well
1998: at any hour escape his cell.''
1999: {96}
2000: XXVI
2001: I see another problem looming:
2002: to save the honour of our land
2003: I must translate -- there's no presuming --
2004: the letter from Tatyana's hand:
2005: her Russian was as thin as vapour,
2006: she never read a Russian paper,
2007: our native speech had never sprung
2008: unhesitating from her tongue,
2009: she wrote in French... what a confession!
2010: what can one do? as said above,
2011: until this day, a lady's love
2012: in Russian never found expression,
2013: till now our language -- proud, God knows --
2014: has hardly mastered postal prose.
2015: XXVII
2016: They should be forced to read in Russian,
2017: I hear you say. But can you see
2018: a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
2019: with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
2020: I ask you, each and every poet!
2021: the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
2022: for whom, to expiate your crimes,
2023: you've made so many secret rhymes,
2024: to whom your hearts are dedicated,
2025: is it not true that Russian speech,
2026: so sketchily possessed by each,
2027: by all is sweetly mutilated,
2028: and it's the foreign phrase that trips
2029: like native idiom from their lips?
2030: {97}
2031: XXVIII
2032: Protect me from such apparition
2033: on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
2034: as bonneted Academician
2035: or seminarist in yellow shawl!
2036: To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
2037: however scarlet; free from error
2038: of grammar, Russian language too.
2039: Now, to my cost it may be true
2040: that generations of new beauties,
2041: heeding the press, will make us look
2042: more closely at the grammar-book;
2043: that verse will turn to useful duties;
2044: on me, all this has no effect:
2045: tradition still keeps my respect.
2046: XXIX
2047: No, incorrect and careless chatter,
2048: words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
2049: evoke emotion's pitter-patter,
2050: now as before, inside my breast;
2051: too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,
2052: I still find Gallicism delicious
2053: as youthful sinning, or the strains
2054: of Bogdanóvich's11 refrains.
2055: But that's enough. My beauty's letter
2056: must now employ my pen; somehow
2057: I gave my word, alas, though now
2058: a blank default would suit me better.
2059: I own it: tender Parny's12 rhyme
2060: is out of fashion in our time.
2061: {98}
2062: XXX
2063: Bard13 of The Feasts, and heart's depression,
2064: if you'd still been with me, dear friend,
2065: I would have had the indiscretion
2066: to ask of you that you transcend
2067: in music's own bewitching fashion
2068: the foreign words a maiden's passion
2069: found for its utterance that night.
2070: Where are you? come -- and my own right
2071: with an obeisance I'll hand over...
2072: But he, by sad and rocky ways,
2073: with heart that's grown unused to praise,
2074: on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
2075: he doesn't hear when I address
2076: his soul with murmurs of distress.
2077: XXXI
2078: Tatyana's letter, treasured ever
2079: as sacred, lies before me still.
2080: I read with secret pain, and never
2081: can read enough to get my fill.
2082: Who taught her an address so tender,
2083: such careless language of surrender?
2084: Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
2085: heartfelt, imploring, touching trash
2086: fraught with enticement and disaster?
2087: It baffles me. But I'll repeat
2088: here a weak version, incomplete,
2089: pale transcript of a vivid master,
2090: or Freischütz as it might be played
2091: by nervous hands of a schoolmaid:
2092: {99}
2093: Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
2094: ``I write to you -- no more confession
2095: is needed, nothing's left to tell.
2096: I know it's now in your discretion
2097: with scorn to make my world a hell.
2098: ``But, if you've kept some faint impression
2099: of pity for my wretched state,
2100: you'll never leave me to my fate.
2101: At first I thought it out of season
2102: to speak; believe me: of my shame
2103: you'd not so much as know the name,
2104: if I'd possessed the slightest reason
2105: to hope that even once a week
2106: I might have seen you, heard you speak
2107: on visits to us, and in greeting
2108: I might have said a word, and then
2109: thought, day and night, and thought again
2110: about one thing, till our next meeting.
2111: But you're not sociable, they say:
2112: you find the country godforsaken;
2113: though we... don't shine in any way,
2114: our joy in you is warmly taken.
2115: ``Why did you visit us, but why?
2116: Lost in our backwoods habitation
2117: I'd not have known you, therefore I
2118: would have been spared this laceration.
2119: In time, who knows, the agitation
2120: of inexperience would have passed,
2121: I would have found a friend, another,
2122: and in the role of virtuous mother
2123: and faithful wife I'd have been cast.
2124: {100}
2125: ``Another!... No, another never
2126: in all the world could take my heart!
2127: Decreed in highest court for ever...
2128: heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;
2129: and my whole life has been directed
2130: and pledged to you, and firmly planned:
2131: I know, Godsent one, I'm protected
2132: until the grave by your strong hand:
2133: you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
2134: unseen, already you were dear,
2135: my soul had heard your voice ring clear,
2136: stirred at your gaze, so strange, so gleaming,
2137: long, long ago... no, that could be
2138: no dream. You'd scarce arrived, I reckoned
2139: to know you, swooned, and in a second
2140: all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
2141: ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
2142: drank in your words when all was still --
2143: helping the poor, or while I mended
2144: with balm of prayer my torn and rended
2145: spirit that anguish had made ill.
2146: At this midnight of my condition,
2147: was it not you, dear apparition,
2148: who in the dark came flashing through
2149: and, on my bed-head gently leaning,
2150: with love and comfort in your meaning,
2151: spoke words of hope? But who are you:
2152: the guardian angel of tradition,
2153: or some vile agent of perdition
2154: sent to seduce? Resolve my doubt.
2155: Oh, this could all be false and vain,
2156: a sham that trustful souls work out;
2157: {101}
2158: fate could be something else again..,
2159: ``So let it be! for you to keep
2160: I trust my fate to your direction,
2161: henceforth in front of you I weep,
2162: I weep, and pray for your protection..,
2163: Imagine it: quite on my own
2164: I've no one here who comprehends me,
2165: and now a swooning mind attends me,
2166: dumb I must perish, and alone.
2167: My heart awaits you: you can turn it
2168: to life and hope with just a glance --
2169: or else disturb my mournful trance
2170: with censure -- I've done all to earn it!
2171: ``I close. I dread to read this page...
2172: for shame and fear my wits are sliding...
2173: and yet your honour is my gage
2174: and in it boldly I'm confiding''...
2175: {102}
2176: XXXII
2177: Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
2178: the letter trembles in her grip;
2179: the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
2180: upon her feverish tongue; the slip
2181: from off her charming shoulder's drooping,
2182: and sideways her poor head is stooping.
2183: But now the radiance of the moon
2184: is dimmed. Down there the valley soon
2185: comes clearer through the mists of dawning.
2186: Down there, by slow degrees, the stream
2187: has taken on a silvery gleam;
2188: the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
2189: and roused the village long ago:
2190: to Tanya, all's an empty show.
2191: XXXIII
2192: She's paid the sunrise no attention,
2193: she sits with head sunk on her breast,
2194: over the note holds in suspension
2195: her seal with its engraven crest.
2196: Softly the door is opened, enter
2197: grey Filatevna, to present her
2198: with a small tray and a teacup.
2199: ``Get up, my child, it's time, get up!
2200: Why, pretty one, you're up already!
2201: My early bird! you know, last night
2202: you gave me such a shocking fright!
2203: but now, thank God, you're well and steady,
2204: your night of fretting's left no trace!
2205: fresh as a poppy-flower, your face.''
2206: {103}
2207: XXXIV
2208: ``Oh nurse, a favour, a petition...''
2209: ``Command me, darling, as you choose.''
2210: ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
2211: but, nurse, you see... Oh, don't refuse...''
2212: ``My sweet, God warrants me your debtor.''
2213: ``Then send your grandson with this letter
2214: quickly to O... I mean to that...
2215: the neighbour... you must tell the brat
2216: that not a syllable be uttered
2217: and not a mention of my name...''
2218: ``Which neighbour, dear? My head became
2219: in these last years all mixed and fluttered.
2220: We've many neighbours round about;
2221: even to count them throws me out.''
2222: XXXV
2223: ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
2224: ``My sweet, my dearest heart, I'm old,
2225: I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
2226: times were when I was sharp and bold:
2227: times were, when master's least suggestion...''
2228: ``Oh nyanya, nyanya, I don't question...
2229: what have your wits to do with me?
2230: Now here's a letter, as you see,
2231: addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.
2232: But don't be cross, my darling friend,
2233: you know I'm hard to comprehend...
2234: Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
2235: ``It's nothing, nurse, nothing, I say...
2236: just send your grandson on his way.''
2237: {104}
2238: XXXVI
2239: Hours pass; no answer; waiting, waiting.
2240: No word: another day goes by.
2241: She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
2242: demanding: when will he reply?
2243: Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
2244: ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
2245: enquired the lady of the hall:
2246: ``it seems that he forgot us all.''
2247: Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
2248: ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
2249: so Lensky answered the old dear:
2250: ``the mail explains the time he's taking.''
2251: Tatyana lowered her regard
2252: as at a censure that was hard.
2253: XXXVII
2254: Day faded; on the table, glowing,
2255: the samovar of evening boiled,
2256: and warmed the Chinese teapot; flowing
2257: beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
2258: Already Olga's hand was gripping
2259: the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
2260: into the cups its darkling stream --
2261: meanwhile a hallboy handed cream;
2262: before the window taking station,
2263: plunged in reflection's deepest train,
2264: Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
2265: and in the misted condensation
2266: with charming forefinger she traced
2267: ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
2268: {105}
2269: XXXVIII
2270: Meanwhile with pain her soul was girdled,
2271: and tears were drowning her regard.
2272: A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
2273: Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
2274: Evgeny! ``Ah!'' Tatyana, fleeting
2275: light as a shadow, shuns a meeting,
2276: through the back porch runs out and flies
2277: down to the garden, and her eyes
2278: daren't look behind her; fairly dashing --
2279: beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,
2280: the allée to the lake, the copse;
2281: breaking the lilac bushes, smashing
2282: parterres, she runs to rivulet's brink,
2283: to gasp, and on a bench to sink.
2284: XXXIX
2285: She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
2286: Oh God, what did he think!'' A dream
2287: of hope is somehow still surviving
2288: in her torn heart -- a fickle gleam;
2289: she trembles, and with fever drumming
2290: awaits him -- hears nobody coming.
2291: Maidservants on the beds just now
2292: were picking berries from the bough,
2293: singing in chorus as directed
2294: (on orders which of course presume
2295: that thievish mouths cannot consume
2296: their masters' berries undetected
2297: so long as they're employed in song:
2298: such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --
2299: {106}
2300: The Song of the Girls
2301: ``Maidens, pretty maidens all,
2302: dear companions, darling friends,
2303: pretty maidens, romp away,
2304: have your fill of revelry!
2305: Strike the ditty up, my sweets,
2306: ditty of our secret world,
2307: and entice a fellow in
2308: to the circle of our dance.
2309: When we draw a fellow in,
2310: when we see him from afar,
2311: darlings, then we'll run away,
2312: cherries then we'll throw at him,
2313: cherries throw and raspberries
2314: and redcurrants throw at him.
2315: Never come and overhear
2316: ditties of our secret world,
2317: never come and like a spy
2318: watch the games we maidens play.''
2319: {107}
2320: XL
2321: They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
2322: choruses, Tanya can but wait,
2323: listless, impatient, for the pounding
2324: within her bosom to abate,
2325: and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;
2326: but wildly still her heart is rushing,
2327: and on her cheeks the fever stays,
2328: more and more brightly still they blaze.
2329: So the poor butterfly will quiver
2330: and beat a nacreous wing when caught
2331: by some perverse schoolboy for sport;
2332: and so in winter-fields will shiver
2333: the hare who from afar has seen
2334: a marksman crouching in the green.
2335: XLI
2336: But finally she heaved a yearning
2337: sigh, and stood up, began to pace;
2338: she walked, but just as she was turning
2339: into the allée, face to face,
2340: she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
2341: still as a shadow, grim and bitter;
2342: seared as by fire, she stopped. Today
2343: I lack the strength required to say
2344: what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
2345: my friends, I need to pause a spell,
2346: and walk, and breathe, before I tell
2347: a story that still wants completing;
2348: I need to rest from all this rhyme:
2349: I'll end my tale some other time.

2366: --------
2367: Chapter Four
2368: La morale est dans la nature des choses.
2369: Necker
2370: (I, II, III, IV, V, VI,1) VII
2371: With womankind, the less we love them,
2372: the easier they become to charm,
2373: the tighter we can stretch above them
2374: enticing nets to do them harm.
2375: There was a period when cold-blooded
2376: debauchery was praised, and studied
2377: as love's technique, when it would blare
2378: its own perfection everywhere,
2379: and heartless pleasure was up-graded;
2380: yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
2381: those monkeys of the good old days:
2382: now Lovelace's renown has faded
2383: as scarlet heels have lost their name
2384: and stately periwigs, their fame.
2385: {109}
2386: VIII
2387: How dull are acting and evasion,
2388: diversely urging the same plea,
2389: earnestly striving for persuasion
2390: on points that all long since agree --
2391: and always the self-same objection;
2392: how dull to work for the correction
2393: of prejudice that's never been
2394: harboured by maidens of thirteen!
2395: Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
2396: threats, vows, and simulated fears,
2397: by six-page letters, rings and tears,
2398: gossip, and tricks, and the patrolling
2399: of aunts and mothers, and the thrall
2400: of husband's friendship -- worst of all!
2401: IX
2402: Evgeny thought in just this fashion.
2403: From his first youth he'd known the force,
2404: the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
2405: its winds had blown him far off course.
2406: Spoilt by the habit of indulgence,
2407: now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
2408: now disenchanted with the next,
2409: more and more bored by yearning's text,
2410: bored by success' giddy trifle,
2411: he heard in stillness and in din
2412: a deathless murmur from within,
2413: found that in laughter yawns could stifle:
2414: he killed eight years in such a style,
2415: and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
2416: {110}
2417: X
2418: Though belles had lost his adoration,
2419: he danced attendance with the best;
2420: rebuffed, found instant consolation;
2421: deceived, was overjoyed to rest.
2422: He followed them without illusion,
2423: lost them without regret's contusion,
2424: scarcely recalled their love, their spite;
2425: just like a casual guest who might
2426: devote to whist an evening party,
2427: who'd sit, and at the end of play
2428: would say goodbye and drive away,
2429: go off to sleep quite hale and hearty,
2430: and in the morning wouldn't know
2431: that self-same evening where he'd go.
2432: XI
2433: Yet Tanya's note made its impression
2434: on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
2435: that virgin dream and its confession
2436: filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;
2437: the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
2438: her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
2439: all plunged his soul deep in the stream
2440: of a delicious, guiltless dream...
2441: and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
2442: and held him briefly in their sway,
2443: Eugene had no wish to betray
2444: a soul so innocent, so trusting.
2445: But to the garden, to the scene
2446: where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
2447: {111}
2448: XII
2449: Moments of silence, quite unbroken;
2450: then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
2451: ``You wrote to me, and nothing spoken
2452: can disavow that. I have read
2453: those words where love, without condition,
2454: pours out its guiltless frank admission,
2455: and your sincerity of thought
2456: is dear to me, for it has brought
2457: feeling to what had long been heartless:
2458: but I won't praise you -- let me join
2459: and pay my debt in the same coin
2460: with an avowal just as artless;
2461: hear my confession as I stand
2462: I leave the verdict in your hand.
2463: XIII
2464: ``Could I be happy circumscribing
2465: my life in a domestic plot;
2466: had fortune blest me by prescribing
2467: husband and father as my lot;
2468: could I accept for just a minute
2469: the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
2470: then I'd have looked for you alone
2471: to be the bride I'd call my own.
2472: Without romance, or false insistence,
2473: I'll say: with past ideals in view
2474: I would have chosen none but you
2475: as helpmeet in my sad existence,
2476: as gage of all things that were good,
2477: and been as happy... as I could!
2478: {112}
2479: XIV
2480: ``But I was simply not intended
2481: for happiness -- that alien role.
2482: Should your perfections be expended
2483: in vain on my unworthy soul?
2484: Believe (as conscience is my warrant),
2485: wedlock for us would be abhorrent.
2486: I'd love you, but inside a day,
2487: with custom, love would fade away;
2488: your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
2489: your grief would fail to touch my heart,
2490: they'd just enrage it with their dart.
2491: What sort of roses, in your notion,
2492: would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
2493: last many a day, and many a night!
2494: XV
2495: ``What in the world is more distressing
2496: than households where the wife must moan
2497: the unworthy husband through depressing
2498: daytimes and evenings passed alone?
2499: and where the husband, recognizing
2500: her worth (but anathematising
2501: his destiny) without a smile
2502: bursts with cold envy and with bile?
2503: For such am I. When you were speaking
2504: to me so simply, with the fires
2505: and force that purity inspires,
2506: is this the man that you were seeking?
2507: can it be true you must await
2508: from cruel fortune such a fate?
2509: {113}
2510: XVI
2511: ``I've dreams and years past resurrection;
2512: a soul that nothing can renew...
2513: I feel a brotherly affection,
2514: or something tenderer still, for you.
2515: Listen to me without resentment:
2516: girls often change to their contentment
2517: light dreams for new ones... so we see
2518: each springtime, on the growing tree,
2519: fresh leaves... for such is heaven's mandate.
2520: You'll love again, but you must teach
2521: your heart some self-restraint; for each
2522: and every man won't understand it
2523: as I have... learn from my belief
2524: that inexperience leads to grief.''
2525: XVII
2526: So went his sermon. Almost dying,
2527: blinded to everything about
2528: by mist of tears, without replying
2529: Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
2530: He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
2531: by what's called machinal reaction,
2532: without a word Tatyana leant
2533: upon it, and with head down-bent
2534: walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
2535: together they arrived, and none
2536: dreamt of reproving what they'd done:
2537: by country freedom, rightful pardon
2538: and happy licence are allowed,
2539: as much as in Moscow the proud.
2540: {114}
2541: XVIII
2542: Agree, the way Eugene proceeded
2543: with our poor girl was kind and good;
2544: not for the first time he succeeded
2545: in manifesting, as he could,
2546: a truly noble disposition;
2547: yet people's malice and suspicion
2548: persisted and made no amends.
2549: By enemies, no less by friends
2550: (it's all the same -- you well correct us),
2551: he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
2552: We each have enemies in this world,
2553: but from our friends, good Lord protect us!
2554: Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
2555: with cause that I've recalled them here.
2556: XIX
2557: What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending
2558: to sleep some black and empty dreams;
2559: but, inside brackets, I'm contending
2560: there's no ignoble tale that seems
2561: cooked-up where garret-vermin babble,
2562: endorsed by fashionable rabble,
2563: there's no absurdity as such,
2564: no vulgar epigram too much,
2565: which smilingly your friend, supported
2566: by decent company, has not,
2567: without a trace of spite or plot,
2568: a hundred times afresh distorted;
2569: yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
2570: he loves you... like your kith and kin!
2571: {115}
2572: XX
2573: Hm, hm. Distinguished reader, tell me
2574: how are your kith and kin today?
2575: And here my sentiments impel me
2576: for your enlightenment to say
2577: how I interpret this expression:
2578: our kin are folk whom by profession
2579: we have to cherish and admire
2580: with all our hearts, and who require
2581: that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
2582: we visit them, or without fail
2583: send them good wishes through the mail
2584: to ensure that till next time our image
2585: won't even cross their minds by stealth...
2586: God grant them years and years of health!
2587: XXI
2588: Of course, the love of tender beauties,
2589: surer than friendship or than kin,
2590: will loyally discharge its duties,
2591: in midst of trouble, storm or din.
2592: Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
2593: yet a capricious inclination,
2594: yet floods of talk around the town...
2595: the darling sex is light as down.
2596: Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
2597: are bound, by every virtuous wife,
2598: to be respected all through life:
2599: and so your faithfullest supporter
2600: will disappear as fast as smoke:
2601: for Satan, love's a splendid joke.
2602: {116}
2603: XXII
2604: Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
2605: On whom alone can we depend?
2606: Who is there who will truly measure
2607: his acts and words to suit our end?
2608: Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
2609: Whose fond attentions will astound us?
2610: Who'll never fault our vices, or
2611: whom shall we never find a bore?
2612: Don't let a ghost be your bear-leader,
2613: don't waste your efforts on the air.
2614: Just let yourself be your whole care,
2615: your loved one, honourable reader!
2616: Deserving object: there can be
2617: nothing more lovable than he.
2618: XXIII
2619: Then what resulted from the meeting?
2620: Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
2621: Love's frantic torments went on beating
2622: and racking with their strain and stress
2623: that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
2624: no, all devoured by passion's madness
2625: poor Tanya more intensely burns;
2626: sleep runs from her, she turns and turns...
2627: and health, life's sweetness and its shimmer,
2628: smiles, and a maiden's tranquil poise,
2629: have vanished, like an empty noise,
2630: while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
2631: so a storm-shadow wraps away
2632: in dark attire the new-born day.
2633: {117}
2634: XXIV
2635: Poor Tanya's bloom begins to languish,
2636: and pale, and fade without a word!
2637: there's nothing can employ her anguish,
2638: no sound by which her soul is stirred.
2639: Neighbours in whispered tones are taking
2640: council, and with profound head-shaking
2641: conclude that it's high time she wed!...
2642: But that's enough. At once, in stead,
2643: I'll gladden your imagination,
2644: reader, by painting you a scene
2645: of happy love. For I have been
2646: too long, against my inclination,
2647: held in constraint by pity's touch:
2648: I love my Tatyana too much!
2649: XXV
2650: From hour to hour a surer capture
2651: for Olga's beauty, Lensky gives
2652: his soul to a delicious rapture
2653: that fills him and in which he lives.
2654: He's always with her: either seated
2655: in darkness in her room, or treated
2656: to garden walks, as arm in arm
2657: they while away the morning's calm.
2658: What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
2659: he even dares, once in a while,
2660: emboldened by his Olga's smile,
2661: and plunged in tender shame's confusion,
2662: to play with a dishevelled tress,
2663: or kiss the border of her dress.
2664: {118}
2665: XXVI
2666: He reads to Olga on occasion,
2667: for her improvement, a roman,
2668: of moralistical persuasion,
2669: more searching than Chateaubriand;
2670: but in it there are certain pages
2671: (vain twaddle, fables of the ages,
2672: talk that might turn a young girl's head)
2673: which with a blush he leaves unread.
2674: As far removed as they were able
2675: from all the world, they sat and pored
2676: in deepest thought at the chess-board
2677: for hours, with elbows on the table --
2678: then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
2679: deep in distraction, his own rook.
2680: XXVII
2681: Even at home his occupation
2682: is only Olga: he relieves
2683: with careful schemes of decoration
2684: an album's loose and floating sheaves.
2685: Sometimes a landscape's represented,
2686: a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
2687: a lyre, and on it perched, a dove --
2688: in ink with colour-wash above;
2689: then on the leaves of recollection,
2690: below the others who have signed
2691: he leaves a tender verse behind,
2692: a dream's mute monument, reflection
2693: of instant thoughts, a fleeting trace
2694: still after many years in place.
2695: {119}
2696: XXVIII
2697: Often of course you'll have inspected
2698: the album of a country miss
2699: where scribbling friends have interjected
2700: frontwise and back, that way and this.
2701: With spelling scrambled to perdition,
2702: the unmetric verses of tradition
2703: are entered here, in friendship's gage,
2704: shortened, or lengthened off the page.
2705: On the first sheet you'll find a question:
2706: ``Qu'écrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?''
2707: and, under, ``toute à vous Annette'';
2708: then, on the last page, the suggestion:
2709: ``who loves you more than I, let's see
2710: him prove it, writing after me.''
2711: XXIX
2712: There you're entirely sure of finding
2713: two hearts, a torch, and a nosegay;
2714: and there, love's protestations, binding
2715: until the tombstone; there one day
2716: some regimental bard has added
2717: a stanza villainously padded.
2718: In such an album, friends, I too
2719: am always glad to write, it's true,
2720: convinced at heart that my most zealous
2721: nonsense will earn indulgent looks,
2722: nor will my scribbling in such books
2723: attract the sneering of the jealous,
2724: or make men seriously discuss
2725: if I show wit in jesting thus.
2726: {120}
2727: XXX
2728: But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
2729: odd volumes from the devil's shelf,
2730: in which the rhymester-man-of-fashion
2731: is forced to crucify himself,
2732: portfolios nobly illustrated
2733: with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
2734: by Baratynsky's3 wondrous pen,
2735: God's thunder burn you up! And when
2736: some splendid lady is referring
2737: to me her best in-quarto tome,
2738: the fear and rage with which I foam!
2739: Deep down, an epigram is stirring
2740: that I'm just longing to indite --
2741: but madrigals I've got to write!
2742: XXXI
2743: No madrigals were for inscribing
2744: by Lensky in his Olga's book;
2745: his style breathed love, and not the gibing
2746: coldness of wit; each note he took,
2747: each news of her he'd been imbibing --
2748: all was material for transcribing:
2749: with lively and pellucid look,
2750: his elegies flow like a brook.
2751: So you, inspired Yazýkov,4 sobbing
2752: with bursts of passion from the heart,
2753: sing God knows whom, compose with art
2754: a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
2755: sooner or later will relate
2756: the entire story of your fate.
2757: {121}
2758: XXXII
2759: But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
2760: bidding us to reject for good
2761: the elegy, grown paralytic,
2762: commands our rhymester-brotherhood:
2763: ``oh, quit your stale, your tedious quacking,
2764: and your alas-ing and alack-ing
2765: about what's buried in the past:
2766: sing about something else at last!''
2767: All right, you want the resurrection
2768: of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,
2769: and dead ideas from that old hoard,
2770: all brought to life at your direction.
2771: Not so? ``No, sirs, the ode's the thing,
2772: that's the refrain that you should sing,
2773: XXXIII
2774: ``as sung of old, in years of glory,
2775: as instituted long ago.''
2776: Only the ode, that solemn story!
2777: Enough, my friends; it's all so-so.
2778: Remember the retort satiric!
2779: Is Others' View,5 that clever lyric,
2780: really more bearable to you
2781: than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?
2782: ``The elegy's just vain protesting,
2783: empty the purpose it proclaims,
2784: while odes have high and noble aims...''
2785: That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
2786: but hold my tongue, lest it appears
2787: I'll set two ages by the ears.
2788: {122}
2789: XXXIV
2790: In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
2791: with storm and tumult in his head,
2792: what odes Vladimir might have written --
2793: but Olga would have never read!
2794: Bards of our tearful generation,
2795: have you read lines of your creation
2796: to your loved ones? They do maintain
2797: that this of all things for a swain
2798: is the supreme reward. Precisely,
2799: blest the poor lover who reads out
2800: his dreams, while she whom they're about,
2801: that languid beauty, listens nicely --
2802: blest... though perhaps her fancy's caught
2803: in fact by some quite different thought.
2804: XXXV
2805: But I myself read my bedizened
2806: fancies, my rhythmic search for truth,
2807: to nobody except a wizened
2808: nanny, companion of my youth;
2809: or, after some dull dinner's labour,
2810: I buttonhole a wandering neighbour
2811: and in a corner make him choke
2812: on tragedy; but it's no joke,
2813: when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
2814: exhausted and done up, I take
2815: a rambling walk beside my lake,
2816: and duck get up; with instant timing,
2817: alarmed by my melodious lay,
2818: they leave their shores and fly away.
2819: {123}
2820: XXXVI6
2821: < My gaze pursues them... but on station
2822: the hunter in the wood will swear
2823: at verse, and hiss an imprecation,
2824: and ease his catch with all due care.
2825: We each enjoy a special hobby,
2826: each of us has his favourite lobby:
2827: one sees a duck and aims his gun,
2828: one raves in verse like me, and one
2829: hunts cheeky flies, with swatter sweeping,
2830: one leads the multitude in thought,
2831: one finds in war amusing sport,
2832: one wallows in delicious weeping;
2833: the wine-addict adores the cup:
2834: and good and bad are all mixed up. >
2835: XXXVII
2836: But what about Eugene? With reason
2837: reader, you ask, and I'll expound --
2838: craving your tolerance in season --
2839: the programme of his daily round.
2840: In summertime -- for he was leading
2841: a hermit's life -- he'd be proceeding
2842: on foot, by seven o'clock, until
2843: he reached the stream below the hill;
2844: lightly attired, like the creator
2845: of Gulnare, he would play a card
2846: out of the hand of that same bard:
2847: he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
2848: he'd drink his coffee, flutter through
2849: the pages of some dull review,
2850: then dress...
2851: {124}
2852: (XXXVIII) XXXIX
2853: Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,
2854: the shady wood, the talking stream;
2855: sometimes from a fair, black-eyed maiden
2856: the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
2857: a steed responsive to the bridle,
2858: and dinner with a touch of idle
2859: fancy, a wine serene in mood,
2860: tranquillity, and solitude --
2861: Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
2862: unconsciously he let it mount
2863: its grip on him, forgot to count
2864: bright summer days that passed so slowly,
2865: forgot to think of town and friends
2866: and tedious means to festive ends.
2867: XL
2868: Our evanescent northern summer
2869: parodies winter in the south;
2870: it's like a vanishing newcomer --
2871: but here we must control our mouth.
2872: The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
2873: and good old sun more seldom glowing;
2874: the days grew shorter, in the glade
2875: with mournful sound the secret shade
2876: was stripped away, and mists encroaching
2877: lay on the fields; in caravan
2878: the clamorous honking geese began
2879: their southward flight: one saw approaching
2880: the season which is such a bore --
2881: November stood outside the door.
2882: {125}
2883: XLI
2884: Dawn comes in mist and chill; no longer
2885: do fields echo with work and shout;
2886: in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
2887: on the highroad the wolves come out;
2888: the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
2889: sets the wise traveller cavorting
2890: up the hillside at breakneck pace;
2891: no longer does the herdsman chase
2892: his beasts outdoors at dawn, nor ringing
2893: at noontime does his horn resound
2894: as it assembles them around;
2895: while in the hut a girl is singing;
2896: she spins and, friend of winter nights,
2897: the matchwood chatters as it lights.
2898: XLII
2899: Hoar-frost that crackles with a will is
2900: already silvering all the plain...
2901: (the reader thinks the rhyme is lilies:
2902: here, seize it quick for this quatrain!)
2903: Like modish parquetry, the river
2904: glitters beneath its icing-sliver;
2905: boy-tribes with skates on loudly slice
2906: their joyous way across the ice;
2907: a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
2908: anticipates a swim, in stead
2909: tries out the ice with cautious tread,
2910: and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
2911: first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
2912: in stars upon the river-brink.
2913: {126}
2914: XLIII
2915: In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
2916: Walking? The country that you roam
2917: is a compulsive bore by reason
2918: of its unvarnished monochrome.
2919: Riding on the lugubrious prairie?
2920: Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
2921: will find the ice elude his grip
2922: and, any moment, down he'll slip.
2923: Or, in your lonely homestead, moping,
2924: you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
2925: to pass the evening. No? then tot
2926: up your accounts, and raging, toping,
2927: let evening pass, tomorrow too --
2928: in triumph you'll see winter through!
2929: XLIV
2930: Childe-Harold-like, Eugene's devoting
2931: his hours to dreaming them away:
2932: he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
2933: and then, indoors the livelong day,
2934: alone, and sunk in calculation,
2935: with a blunt cue for the duration,
2936: from early morning on he will
2937: at two-ball billiards prove his skill;
2938: then, country evening fast arriving,
2939: billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:
2940: before the fire a table's spread;
2941: Evgeny waits: and here comes driving,
2942: with three roan horses in a line
2943: Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
2944: {127}
2945: XLV
2946: From widow Clicquot and from Moët,
2947: the draught whose blessings are agreed,
2948: in frosted bottle, for the poet
2949: is brought to table at full speed.
2950: Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
2951: once, with its foaming and its playing,
2952: (a simile of this and that)
2953: it held me captive; tit for tat,
2954: friends, recollect how I surrendered
2955: my last poor lepton for a sup!
2956: recall, by its bewitching cup,
2957: how many follies were engendered;
2958: how many lines of verse, and themes
2959: for jokes, and rows, and merry dreams!
2960: XLVI
2961: Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
2962: perfidious blow to my inside,
2963: and now it's Bordeaux the Judicious
2964: that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
2965: to Aÿ's vintage in the sequel
2966: I find myself no longer equal;
2967: for, mistress-like, it's brilliant, vain,
2968: lively, capricious, and inane...
2969: But in misfortune or displeasure,
2970: Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
2971: a true companion to the end,
2972: ready to share our quiet leisure
2973: with your good offices, and so
2974: long life to our dear friend, Bordeaux!
2975: {128}
2976: XLVII
2977: The fire was dying; cinders faintly
2978: covered the golden coal -- the steam
2979: tumbled and whirled and twisted quaintly
2980: its barely noticeable stream.
2981: The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
2982: Straight up the chimney, pipes were smoking.
2983: Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
2984: and evening now drew on in mist...
2985: (I like a friendly conversation,
2986: the enjoyment of a friendly drink,
2987: at hours, which, why I cannot think,
2988: somehow have got the designation
2989: of time between the wolf and dog.)
2990: Now hear the friends in dialogue:
2991: XLVIII
2992: ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
2993: and how's Tatyana? Olga too,
2994: your dashing one, is she surviving?''
2995: ``Just half a glass more... that will do...
2996: All flourishing; they send their duty.
2997: Take Olga's shoulders now -- the beauty!
2998: What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
2999: visit the family, what d'you say?
3000: if you come with me, they'll be flattered;
3001: or else, my friend, how does it look?
3002: you called there twice, and since then took
3003: no notice of them. But I've chattered
3004: so much, I'm left no time to speak!
3005: of course! you're bidden there next week.''
3006: {129}
3007: XLIX
3008: ``I?'' ``Saturday. The invitation
3009: Olinka and her mother sent:
3010: Tatyana's name day celebration.
3011: It's right and proper that you went.''
3012: ``But there'll be such a rout and scrabble
3013: with every different kind of rabble...''
3014: ``No, no, I'm sure the party's small.
3015: Relations. No-one else at all.
3016: Let's go, our friendship's worth the labour!''
3017: ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
3018: He drained his glass down to the end
3019: by way of toast to their fair neighbour;
3020: then he began to talk once more
3021: of Olga: love's that kind of bore!
3022: L
3023: Lensky rejoiced. His designated
3024: rapture was just two weeks ahead;
3025: love's crown, delectable, awaited
3026: his transports, and the marriage-bed
3027: in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
3028: the pain, the grief, the marrow-freezing
3029: onset of the incipient yawn,
3030: were from his vision quite withdrawn.
3031: While under the connubial banner
3032: I can see naught, as Hymen's foe,
3033: beyond a string of dull tableaux,
3034: a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...
3035: my wretched Lensky in his heart
3036: was just created for the part.
3037: {130}
3038: LI
3039: And he was loved... at least he never
3040: doubted of it, so lived in bliss.
3041: Happy a hundredfold, whoever
3042: can lean on faith, who can dismiss
3043: cold reason, sleep in sensual welter
3044: like a drunk traveller in a shelter,
3045: or, sweeter, like a butterfly
3046: in flowers of spring it's drinking dry:
3047: but piteous he, the all-foreseeing,
3048: the sober head, detesting each
3049: human reaction, every speech
3050: in the expression of its being,
3051: whose heart experience has cooled
3052: and saved from being charmed or fooled!
3053: {131}

3065: --------
3066: Chapter Five
3067: O, never know these frightful dreams,
3068: thou, my Svetlana!
3069: Zhukovsky
3070: I
3071: That year the season was belated
3072: and autumn lingered, long and slow;
3073: expecting winter, nature waited --
3074: only in January the snow,
3075: night of the second, started flaking.
3076: Next day Tatyana, early waking,
3077: saw through the window, morning-bright,
3078: roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
3079: panes patterned by the finest printer,
3080: with trees decked in their silvery kit,
3081: and jolly magpies on the flit,
3082: and hills that delicately winter
3083: had with its brilliant mantle crowned --
3084: and glittering whiteness all around.
3085: {132}
3086: II
3087: Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
3088: breaks a new passage with his sleigh;
3089: his nag has smelt the snow, and planted
3090: a shambling hoof along the way;
3091: a saucy kibítka is slicing
3092: its furrow through the powdery icing;
3093: the driver sits and cuts a dash
3094: in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash.
3095: Here comes the yard-boy, who has chosen
3096: his pup to grace the sledge, while he
3097: becomes a horse for all to see;
3098: the rogue has got a finger frozen:
3099: it hurts, he laughs, and all in vain
3100: his mother taps the window-pane.
3101: III
3102: But you perhaps find no attraction
3103: in any picture of this kind:
3104: for nature's unadorned reaction
3105: has something low and unrefined.
3106: Fired by the god of inspiration,
3107: another bard1 in exaltation
3108: has painted for us the first snow
3109: with each nuance of wintry glow:
3110: he'll charm you with his fine invention,
3111: he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
3112: secret sledge-rides in verse of fire;
3113: but I've not got the least intention
3114: just now of wrestling with his shade,
3115: nor his,2 who sings of Finland's maid.
3116: {133}
3117: IV
3118: Tanya (profoundly Russian being,
3119: herself not knowing how or why)
3120: in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
3121: the cold perfection of the sky,
3122: hoar-frost and sun in freezing weather,
3123: sledges, and tardy dawns together
3124: with the pink glow the snows assume
3125: and festal evenings in the gloom.
3126: The Larins kept the old tradition:
3127: maid-servants from the whole estate
3128: would on those evenings guess the fate
3129: of the two girls; their premonition
3130: pointed each year, for time to come,
3131: at soldier-husbands, and the drum.
3132: V
3133: Tatyana shared with full conviction
3134: the simple faith of olden days
3135: in dreams and cards and their prediction,
3136: and portents of the lunar phase.
3137: Omens dismayed her with their presage;
3138: each object held a secret message
3139: for her instruction, and her breast
3140: was by forebodings much oppressed.
3141: The tomcat, mannered and affected,
3142: that sat above the stove and purred
3143: and washed its face, to her brought word
3144: that visitors must be expected.
3145: If suddenly aloft she spied
3146: the new moon, horned, on her left side,
3147: {134}
3148: VI
3149: her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
3150: In the dark sky, a shooting star
3151: that fell, and then began to shiver,
3152: would fill Tatyana from afar
3153: with perturbation and with worry;
3154: and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
3155: to whisper it her inmost prayer.
3156: And if she happened anywhere
3157: to meet a black monk, or if crossing
3158: her path a hare in headlong flight
3159: ran through the fields, sheer panic fright
3160: would leave her dithering and tossing.
3161: By dire presentiment awestruck,
3162: already she'd assume ill-luck.
3163: VII
3164: Yet -- fear itself she found presented
3165: a hidden beauty in the end:
3166: our disposition being invented
3167: by nature, contradiction's friend.
3168: Christmas came on. What joy, what gladness!
3169: Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
3170: youth which has nothing to regret,
3171: before which life's horizon yet
3172: lies bright, and vast beyond perceiving;
3173: spectacled age divines as well,
3174: although it's nearly heard the knell,
3175: and all is lost beyond retrieving;
3176: no matter: hope, in child's disguise,
3177: is there to lisp its pack of lies.
3178: {135}
3179: VIII
3180: Tatyana looks with pulses racing
3181: at sunken wax inside a bowl:
3182: beyond a doubt, its wondrous tracing
3183: foretells for her some wondrous role;
3184: from dish of water, rings are shifted
3185: in due succession; hers is lifted
3186: and at the very self-same time
3187: the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
3188: ``The peasants there have wealth abounding,
3189: they heap up silver with a spade;
3190: and those we sing for will be paid
3191: in goods and fame!'' But the sad-sounding
3192: ditty portends a loss; more dear
3193: is ``Kit''3 to every maiden's ear.
3194: IX
3195: The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
3196: the heavenly lights in glorious quire
3197: tread the calm, settled path they've chosen...
3198: Tatyana in low-cut attire
3199: goes out into the courtyard spaces
3200: and trains a mirror till it faces
3201: the moon; but in the darkened glass
3202: the only face to shake and pass
3203: is sad old moon's... Hark! snow is creaking...
3204: a passer-by; and on tiptoe
3205: she flies as fast as she can go;
3206: and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
3207: in a melodious, flute-like tone.
3208: He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
3209: {136}
3210: X
3211: Prepared for prophecy and fable,
3212: she did what nurse advised she do
3213: and in the bath-house had a table
3214: that night, in secret, set for two;
3215: then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
3216: I too -- when I recall Svetlana5
3217: I'm terrified -- so let it be...
3218: Tatyana's rites are not for me.
3219: She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
3220: Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
3221: Lel6 floats about above her head;
3222: and underneath her downy pillow
3223: a young girl's looking-glass is kept.
3224: Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
3225: XI
3226: She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
3227: she walked across a snowy plain
3228: through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
3229: a furious, boiling, heaving main
3230: across the drift-encumbered acres,
3231: a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
3232: a flood on which no frosty band
3233: had been imposed by winter's hand;
3234: two poles that ice had glued like plaster
3235: were placed across the gulf to make
3236: a flimsy bridge whose every quake
3237: spelt hazard, ruin and disaster;
3238: she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
3239: perplexed... and rooted to the ground.
3240: {137}
3241: XII
3242: As if before some mournful parting
3243: Tatyana groaned above the tide;
3244: she saw no friendly figure starting
3245: to help her from the other side;
3246: but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
3247: and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
3248: enormous bear; Tatyana yelled,
3249: the bear let out a roar, and held
3250: a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
3251: her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
3252: and with a halting, trembling gait
3253: above the water started tracing
3254: her way; she passed, then as she walked
3255: the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
3256: XIII
3257: A backward look is fraught with danger;
3258: she speeds her footsteps to a race,
3259: but from her shaggy-liveried ranger
3260: she can't escape at any pace --
3261: the odious bear still grunts and lumbers.
3262: Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
3263: in the full beauty of its frown;
3264: the branches all are weighted down
3265: with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
3266: summits of aspen, birch and lime,
3267: the nightly luminaries climb.
3268: No path to see: the snow has drifted
3269: across each bush, across each steep,
3270: and all the world is buried deep.
3271: {138}
3272: XIV
3273: She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
3274: There's powdery snow up to her knees;
3275: now a protruding branch assails her
3276: and clasps her neck; and now she sees
3277: her golden earrings off and whipping;
3278: and now the crunchy snow is stripping
3279: her darling foot of its wet shoe,
3280: her handkerchief has fallen too;
3281: no time to pick it up -- she's dying
3282: with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
3283: her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
3284: to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
3285: and he pursuing, till at length
3286: she flies no more, she's lost her strength.
3287: XV
3288: She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
3289: the bear has raised her in his paws;
3290: and she, submissively, inertly --
3291: no move she makes, no breath she draws;
3292: he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
3293: shows up through trees, all of a grovel
3294: in darkest forest depths and drowned
3295: by dreary snowdrifts piled around;
3296: there's a small window shining in it,
3297: and from within come noise and cheer;
3298: the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
3299: come in and warm yourself a minute!''
3300: he carries her inside the door
3301: and sets her gently on the floor.
3302: {139}
3303: XVI
3304: Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
3305: bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
3306: behind the door the clash of glasses
3307: and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
3308: so, seeing there no rhyme or reason,
3309: no meaning in or out of season,
3310: she peers discreetly through a chink
3311: and sees... whatever do you think?
3312: a group of monsters round a table,
3313: a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
3314: a rooster head, and on the twitch
3315: a skeleton jerked by a cable,
3316: a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
3317: a hybrid cross of cat and crane.
3318: XVII
3319: But ever stranger and more fearful:
3320: a crayfish rides on spider-back;
3321: on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful
3322: and swaggers in a red calpack;
3323: with bended knees a windmill dances,
3324: its sails go flap-flap as it prances;
3325: song, laughter, whistle, bark and champ,
3326: and human words, and horse's stamp!
3327: But how she jumped, when in this hovel
3328: among the guests she recognized
3329: the man she feared and idolized --
3330: who else? -- the hero of our novel!
3331: Onegin sits at table too,
3332: he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
3333: {140}
3334: XVIII
3335: He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
3336: he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
3337: he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
3338: he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
3339: he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
3340: Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
3341: and, curious now about the lot,
3342: opens the door a tiny slot...
3343: but then a sudden breeze surprises,
3344: puts out the lamps; the whole brigade
3345: of house-familiars stands dismayed...
3346: with eyes aflame Onegin rises
3347: from table, clattering on the floor;
3348: all stand. He walks towards the door.
3349: XIX
3350: Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
3351: Tatyana struggles to run out --
3352: she can't; and in her panic hurry
3353: she flails around, she tries to shout --
3354: she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
3355: and to the vision of those mortal
3356: monsters the maiden stood revealed.
3357: Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
3358: the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
3359: the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
3360: the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
3361: the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
3362: all point at her, and all combine
3363: to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
3364: {141}
3365: XX
3366: ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
3367: clears in a flash the freezing room;
3368: the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
3369: the girl remains there in the gloom
3370: alone with him; Onegin takes her
3371: into a corner, gently makes her
3372: sit on a flimsy bench, and lays
3373: his head upon her shoulder... blaze
3374: of sudden brightness... it's too curious...
3375: Olga's appeared upon the scene,
3376: and Lensky follows her... Eugene,
3377: eyes rolling, arms uplifted, furious,
3378: damns the intruders; Tanya lies
3379: and almost swoons, and almost dies.
3380: XXI
3381: Louder and louder sounds the wrangle:
3382: Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
3383: a carving-knife -- and in the tangle
3384: Lensky's thrown down. The murk is thick
3385: and growing thicker; then, heart-shaking,
3386: a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
3387: Tanya comes to in utter fright...
3388: she looks, the room is getting light --
3389: outside, the scarlet rays of dawning
3390: play on the window's frosted lace;
3391: in through the door, at swallow's pace,
3392: pinker than glow of Northern morning,
3393: flits Olga: ``now, tell me straight out,
3394: who was it that you dreamt about?''
3395: {142}
3396: XXII
3397: Deaf to her sister's intervention,
3398: Tatyana simply lay in bed,
3399: devoured a book with rapt attention,
3400: and kept quite silent while she read.
3401: The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
3402: no magic fancies of the poet,
3403: no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;
3404: and yet by Vergil or Racine
3405: by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
3406: even by Ladies' Fashion Post,
3407: no one was ever so engrossed:
3408: Martin Zadéka was the siren,
3409: dean of Chaldea's learned team,
3410: arch-commentator of the dream.
3411: XXIII
3412: This work of the profoundest learning
3413: was brought there by a huckster who
3414: one day came down that lonely turning,
3415: and to Tanya, when he was through,
3416: swapped it for odd tomes of Malvina,
3417: but just to make the bargain keener,
3418: he charged three roubles and a half,
3419: and took two Petriads in calf,
3420: a grammar, a digest of fable,
3421: and volume three of Marmontel.
3422: Since then Martin Zadéka's spell
3423: bewitches Tanya... he is able
3424: to comfort her in all her woes,
3425: and every night shares her repose.
3426: {143}
3427: XXIV
3428: Tatyana's haunted by her vision,
3429: plagued by her ghastly dream, and tries
3430: to puzzle out with some precision
3431: just what the nightmare signifies.
3432: Searching the table exegetic
3433: she finds, in order alphabetic:
3434: bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,
3435: fir, forest, hedgehog, raven, snow
3436: etcetera. But her trepidation
3437: Martin Zadéka fails to mend;
3438: the horrid nightmare must portend
3439: a hideous deal of tribulation.
3440: For several days she peaked and pined
3441: in deep anxiety of mind.
3442: XXV
3443: But now Aurora's crimson fingers
3444: from daybreak valleys lift the sun;
3445: the morning light no longer lingers,
3446: the festal name day has begun.
3447: Since dawn, whole families have been driving
3448: towards the Larins' and arriving
3449: in sledded coaches and coupés,
3450: in britzkas, kibítkas and sleighs.
3451: The hall is full of noise and hustle,
3452: in the salon new faces meet,
3453: and kisses smack as young girls greet;
3454: there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
3455: the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
3456: guests bow, feet scrape, and children squall.
3457: {144}
3458: XXVI
3459: Here with his wife, that bulging charmer,
3460: fat Pústyakov has driven in;
3461: Gvozdín, exemplary farmer,
3462: whose serfs are miserably thin;
3463: and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
3464: with broods of children of all ages,
3465: from thirty down to two; and stop,
3466: here's Petushkóv, the local fop;
3467: and look, my cousin's come, Buyánov,
3468: in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --
3469: you'll recognize him soon enough, --
3470: and counsellor (retired) Flyánov,
3471: that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
3472: bribe-taker, glutton and buffoon.
3473: XXVII
3474: Here, in his red peruke and glasses,
3475: late of Tambov, Monsieur Triquet
3476: has come with Kharlikov; he passes
3477: for witty; in his Gallic way
3478: inside a pocket Triquet nurses,
3479: addressed to Tanya, certain verses
3480: set to well-known children's glee:
3481: ``réveillez-vous, belle endormie.''
3482: He found them in some old collection,
3483: printed among outmoded airs;
3484: Triquet, ingenious poet, dares
3485: to undertake their resurrection,
3486: and for belle Nina, as it read,
3487: he's put belle Tatiana instead.
3488: {145}
3489: XXVIII
3490: And from the nearby Army station
3491: the Major's here: he's all the rage
3492: with our Mamas, and a sensation
3493: with demoiselles of riper age;
3494: his news has set the party humming!
3495: the regimental band is coming,
3496: sent at the Colonel's own behest.
3497: A ball: the joy of every guest!
3498: Young ladies jump for future blisses...
3499: But dinner's served, so two by two
3500: and arm in arm they all go through;
3501: round Tanya congregate the misses,
3502: the men confront them, face to face:
3503: they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
3504: XXIX
3505: They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
3506: jaws masticate as minutes pass:
3507: the crash of plates and knives is blended
3508: with the resounding chime of glass.
3509: And now there's gradually beginning
3510: among the guests a general dinning:
3511: none listens when the others speak,
3512: all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
3513: Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
3514: Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
3515: the hostess cries and, moving fast,
3516: the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
3517: they shove each plate, and every chair,
3518: and shout, and make room for the pair.
3519: {146}
3520: XXX
3521: Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
3522: and paler than the moon at dawn,
3523: she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
3524: and trembles like a hunted fawn.
3525: From violent passions fast pulsating
3526: she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
3527: the friends' salute she never hears
3528: and from her eyes the eager tears
3529: are almost bursting; she's quite ready,
3530: poor girl, to drop into a faint,
3531: but will, and reason's strong constraint,
3532: prevailed, and with composure steady
3533: she sat there; through her teeth a word
3534: came out so soft, it scarce was heard.
3535: XXXI
3536: The nervous-tragical reaction,
3537: girls' tears, their swooning, for Eugene
3538: had long proved tedious to distraction:
3539: he knew too well that sort of scene.
3540: Now, faced with this enormous revel,
3541: he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
3542: He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
3543: looked down in an access of hate,
3544: pouted, and swore in furious passion
3545: to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
3546: the best revenge one could desire.
3547: Already, in exultant fashion,
3548: he watched the guests and, as he dined,
3549: caricatured them in his mind.
3550: {147}
3551: XXXII
3552: Tanya's distress had risked detection
3553: not only by Evgeny's eye;
3554: but looks and talk took the direction,
3555: that moment, of a luscious pie
3556: (alas, too salted); now they're bringing
3557: bottles to which some pitch is clinging:
3558: Tsimlyansky wine, between the meat
3559: and the blancmanger, then a fleet
3560: of goblets, tall and slender pretties;
3561: how they remind me of your stem,
3562: Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
3563: you object of my guileless ditties!
3564: with draughts from love's enticing flask,
3565: you made me drunk as one could ask!
3566: XXXIII
3567: Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle
3568: explodes; wine fizzes up... but stay:
3569: solemn, too long compelled to throttle
3570: his itching verse, Monsieur Triquet
3571: is on his feet -- in utter stillness
3572: the party waits. Seized with an illness
3573: of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
3574: and, scroll in hand, before her eyes
3575: Triquet sings, out of tune. Loud clapping
3576: and cheers salute him. Tanya must
3577: thank him by curtseying to the dust;
3578: great bard despite his modest trapping,
3579: he's first to toast her in the bowl,
3580: then he presents her with the scroll.
3581: {148}
3582: XXXIV
3583: Compliment and congratulation;
3584: Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.
3585: When Eugene's turn for salutation
3586: arrives, the girl's exhausted gaze,
3587: her discomposure, her confusion,
3588: expose his soul to an intrusion
3589: of pity: in his silent bow,
3590: and in his look there shows somehow
3591: a wondrous tenderness. And whether
3592: it was that he'd been truly stirred,
3593: or half-unwittingly preferred
3594: a joking flirt, or both together,
3595: there was a softness in his glance:
3596: it brought back Tanya from her trance.
3597: XXXV
3598: Chairs are pushed outward, loudly rumbling,
3599: and all into the salon squeeze,
3600: as from their luscious hive go tumbling
3601: fieldward, in noisy swarm, the bees.
3602: The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
3603: neighbours in high content are wheezing;
3604: ladies at the fireside confer,
3605: in corners whispering girls concur;
3606: now, by green tablecloths awaited,
3607: the eager players are enrolled --
3608: Boston and ombre for the old,
3609: and whist, that's now so keenly fêted --
3610: pursuits of a monotonous breed
3611: begot by boredom out of greed.
3612: {149}
3613: XXXVI
3614: By now whist's heroes have completed
3615: eight rubbers; and by now eight times
3616: they've moved around and been reseated;
3617: and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
3618: I like to tell the time by dinner
3619: and tea and supper; there's an inner
3620: clock in the country rings the hour;
3621: no fuss; our belly has the power
3622: of any Bréguet: and in passing
3623: I'll just remark, my verses talk
3624: as much of banquets and the cork
3625: and eatables beyond all classing
3626: as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
3627: whom thirty centuries have adored!
3628: < XXXVII7
3629: At feasts, though, full of pert aggression,
3630: I put your genius to the test,
3631: I make magnanimous confession,
3632: in other things you come off best:
3633: your heroes, raging and ferocious,
3634: your battles, lawless and atrocious,
3635: your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
3636: have clearly got the upper hand
3637: of Eugene, cold as all creation,
3638: of plains where boredom reigns complete,
3639: or of Istómina, my sweet,
3640: and all our modish education;
3641: but your vile Helen's not my star --
3642: no, Tanya's more endearing far.
3643: {150}
3644: XXXVIII
3645: No one will think that worth gainsaying,
3646: though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
3647: may spend a century in flaying
3648: the hapless Phrygians all the same,
3649: and although Troy's greybeards, collected
3650: around Priam the much-respected,
3651: may chorus, when she comes in sight,
3652: that Menelaus was quite right --
3653: and Paris too. But hear my pleading:
3654: as battles go, I've not begun;
3655: don't judge the race before it's run --
3656: be good enough to go on reading:
3657: there'll be a fight. For that I give
3658: my word; no welshing, as I live. >
3659: XXXIX
3660: Here's tea: the girls have just, as bidden,
3661: taken the saucers in their grip,
3662: when, from behind the doorway, hidden
3663: bassoons and flutes begin to trip.
3664: Elated by the music's blaring,
3665: Petushkóv, local Paris, tearing,
3666: his tea with rum quite left behind,
3667: approaches Olga; Lensky's signed
3668: Tatyana on; Miss Kharlikova,
3669: that nubile maid of riper age,
3670: is seized by Tambov's poet-sage;
3671: Buyánov whirls off Pustyakova;
3672: they all have swarmed into the hall,
3673: and in full brilliance shines the ball.
3674: {151}
3675: XL
3676: Right at the outset of my story
3677: (if you'll turn back to chapter one)
3678: I meant to paint, with Alban's8 glory,
3679: a ball in Petersburg; but fun
3680: and charming reverie's vain deflection
3681: absorbed me in the recollection
3682: of certain ladies' tiny feet.
3683: Enough I've wandered in the suite
3684: of your slim prints! though this be treason
3685: to my young days, it's time I turned
3686: to wiser words and deeds, and learned
3687: to demonstrate some signs of reason:
3688: let no more such digressions lurk
3689: in this fifth chapter of my work.
3690: XLI
3691: And now, monotonously dashing
3692: like mindless youth, the waltz goes by
3693: with spinning noise and senseless flashing
3694: as pair by pair the dancers fly.
3695: Revenge's hour is near, and after
3696: Evgeny, full of inward laughter,
3697: has gone to Olga, swept the girl
3698: past all the assembly in a whirl,
3699: he takes her to a chair, beginning
3700: to talk of this and that, but then
3701: after two minutes, off again,
3702: they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
3703: All are dumbfounded. Lensky shies
3704: away from trusting his own eyes.
3705: {152}
3706: XLII
3707: Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
3708: used in times past to ring a peal
3709: that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
3710: while floors would split from crash of heel,
3711: and frames would shudder, windows tremble;
3712: now things are changed, now we resemble
3713: ladies who glide on waxed parquet.
3714: Yet the mazurka keeps today
3715: in country towns and suchlike places
3716: its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,
3717: and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
3718: as fresh as ever, for its graces
3719: are here untouched by fashion's reign,
3720: our modern Russia's plague and bane.
3721: XLIII7
3722: ... ...
3723: < Petushkóv's nails and spurs are sounding
3724: (that half-pay archivist); and bounding
3725: Buyánov's heels have split the wood
3726: and wrecked the flooring-boards for good;
3727: there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
3728: the deeper in the wood, the more
3729: the logs; the wild ones have the floor;
3730: they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
3731: Ah, gently, gently, easy goes --
3732: your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
3733: {153}
3734: XLIV
3735: Buyánov, my vivacious cousin,
3736: leads Olga and Tatyana on
3737: to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
3738: Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
3739: he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
3740: he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
3741: whispers some ballad of the hour,
3742: squeezes her hand -- and brings to flower
3743: on her smug face a flush of pleasure.
3744: Lensky has watched: his rage has blazed,
3745: he's lost his self-command, and crazed
3746: with jealousy beyond all measure
3747: insists, when the mazurka ends,
3748: on the cotillion, as amends.
3749: XLV
3750: He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
3751: No, she's already pledged her word
3752: to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
3753: How could she? why, he'd never heard...
3754: scarce out of bibs, already fickle,
3755: fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,
3756: already studying to intrigue,
3757: already high in treason's league!
3758: He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
3759: so, cursing women's devious course,
3760: he leaves the house, calls for his horse
3761: and gallops. Pistols made for pairing
3762: and just a double charge of shot
3763: will in a flash decide his lot.
3764: {154}

3780: --------
3781: Chapter Six
3782: La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi.
3783: Nasce una gente a cui 'l morir non dole.
3784: Petrarch
3785: I
3786: Seeing Vladimir had defected,
3787: Eugene, at Olga's side, was racked
3788: by fresh ennui as he reflected
3789: with pleasure on his vengeful act.
3790: Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
3791: and looked for Lensky, while the labour
3792: of the cotillion's endless theme
3793: oppressed her like a heavy dream.
3794: It's over. Supper is proceeding.
3795: Beds are made up; the guests are all
3796: packed from the maids' wing to the hall.
3797: Each one by now is badly needing
3798: a place for rest. Eugene alone
3799: has driven off, to find his own.
3800: {155}
3801: II
3802: All sleep: from the saloon a roaring
3803: proclaims where ponderous Pústyakov
3804: beside his heavier half is snoring.
3805: Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
3806: and Flyánov, amply lubricated,
3807: on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
3808: the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
3809: in flannel, and an old fur cap.
3810: In the two sisters' rooms extended,
3811: the maidens all are slumbering deep.
3812: Only Tatyana does not sleep,
3813: but at the window, in the splendid
3814: radiance of Dian, sits in pain
3815: and looks out on the darkened plain.
3816: III
3817: His unexpected apparition,
3818: the fleeting tenderness that stole
3819: into his look, the exhibition
3820: with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
3821: she can't make out a single fraction
3822: of his intent; and a reaction
3823: of jealousy has made her start,
3824: as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
3825: as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
3826: a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I
3827: am doomed to perish, yet to die
3828: through him is sweetness' self. In grumbling
3829: I find no sense; the truth is this,
3830: it's not in him to bring me bliss.''
3831: {156}
3832: IV
3833: But onward, onward with my story!
3834: A new acquaintance claims our quill.
3835: Five versts or so from Krasnogórie,
3836: Lensky's estate, there lives and still
3837: thrives to this moment, in a station
3838: of philosophic isolation,
3839: Zarétsky, sometime king of brawls
3840: and hetman of the gambling-halls,
3841: arch-rake, pothouse tribune-persona,
3842: but now grown plain and kind in stead,
3843: paterfamilias (unwed),
3844: unswerving friend, correct landowner,
3845: and even honourable man:
3846: so, if we want to change, we can!
3847: V
3848: The world of fashion, prone to flatter,
3849: praised his fierce courage in its day:
3850: true, with a pistol he could shatter
3851: an ace a dozen yards away;
3852: it's also true, in battle's rapture,
3853: the circumstances of his capture
3854: had made his name, when, bold as bold,
3855: down from his Kalmuck steed he rolled
3856: into the mud, a drunken goner,
3857: and taken by the French -- some prize! --
3858: resigned himself to prison's ties,
3859: like Regulus, that god of honour,
3860: in order daily, chez Véry,1
3861: to drain, on credit, bottles three.
3862: {157}
3863: VI
3864: Time was, he'd been the wittiest ever,
3865: so brilliantly he'd hoax the fools,
3866: so gloriously he'd fool the clever,
3867: using overt or covert rules.
3868: Sometimes his tricks would earn him trouble,
3869: or cause the bursting of his bubble,
3870: sometimes he'd fall into a trap
3871: himself just like a simple chap.
3872: But he could draw a joking moral,
3873: return an answer, blunt or keen,
3874: use cunning silence as a screen,
3875: or cunningly create a quarrel,
3876: get two young friends to pick a fight,
3877: and put them on a paced-out site.
3878: VII
3879: Or he knew how to reconcile them
3880: so that all three went off to lunch,
3881: then later slyly he'd revile them
3882: with lies and jokes that packed a punch:
3883: sed alia tempora! The devil
3884: (like passion's dream, that other revel)
3885: goes out of us when youth is dead.
3886: So my Zaretsky, as I said,
3887: beneath bird-cherries and acacias
3888: has found a port for his old age,
3889: and lives, a veritable sage,
3890: for planting cabbage, like Horatius,
3891: and breeding ducks and geese as well,
3892: and teaching children how to spell.
3893: {158}
3894: VIII
3895: He was no fool; appreciated
3896: by my Eugene, not for his heart,
3897: but for the effect that he created
3898: of sense and judgement. For his part
3899: his converse gave Onegin pleasure;
3900: so it was not in any measure,
3901: the morning after, a surprise
3902: when our Zaretsky met his eyes.
3903: His visitor from the beginning
3904: broke greetings off, and gave Eugene
3905: a note from Lensky; in between
3906: Zaretsky watched, and stood there grinning.
3907: Onegin without more ado
3908: crossed to the window, read it through.
3909: IX
3910: Pleasant, in spite of its compression,
3911: gentlemanly, quite precise,
3912: Vladimir's challenge found expression
3913: that, though polite, was clear as ice.
3914: Eugene's response was automatic;
3915: he informed this envoy diplomatic
3916: in terms where not a word was spared:
3917: at any time he'd be prepared.
3918: Zaretsky rose without discussion;
3919: he saw no point in staying on,
3920: with work at home; but when he'd gone,
3921: Evgeny, whom the repercussion
3922: left quite alone with his own soul,
3923: was far from happy with his role.
3924: {159}
3925: X
3926: With reason, too: for when he'd vetted
3927: in secret judgement what he'd done,
3928: he found too much that he regretted:
3929: last night he'd erred in making fun,
3930: so heartless and so detrimental,
3931: of love so timorous and gentle.
3932: In second place the poet might
3933: have been a fool; yet he'd a right,
3934: at eighteen years, to some compassion.
3935: Evgeny loved him from his heart,
3936: and should have played a different part:
3937: no softball for the winds of fashion,
3938: no boy, to fight or take offence --
3939: the man of honour and of sense.
3940: XI
3941: He could have spoken without harming,
3942: need not have bristled like a beast;
3943: he should have settled for disarming
3944: that youthful heart. ``But now at least
3945: it's late, time's passing... not to mention,
3946: in our affair, the intervention
3947: of that old duellistic fox,
3948: that wicked, loose-tongue chatterbox...
3949: True, scorn should punish and should bridle
3950: his wit, according to the rules
3951: but whispers, the guffaw of fools...''
3952: Public opinion -- here's our idol,
3953: the spring of honour, and the pin
3954: on which the world is doomed to spin.
3955: {160}
3956: XII
3957: Lensky at home awaits the answer,
3958: impatient, hatred flaming high;
3959: but here comes our loud-talking prancer
3960: who swaggers in with the reply.
3961: The jealous poet's gloom is lightened!
3962: knowing the offender, he'd been frightened
3963: lest he should by some clever trick
3964: avert his chest from pistol's click,
3965: smoothe his way out with humour's ointment.
3966: But now Vladimir's doubts are still:
3967: early tomorrow at the mill
3968: before first light they have appointment,
3969: to raise the safety catch and strain
3970: to hit the target: thigh or brain.
3971: XIII
3972: Still blazing with resentment's fuel,
3973: and set on hating the coquette,
3974: Lensky resolved before the duel
3975: not to see Olga; in a fret
3976: watched sun and clock -- then by such labours
3977: defeated, turned up at his neighbour's.
3978: He thought that Olga'd be confused,
3979: struck down as if she'd been accused,
3980: when he arrived; not in the slightest:
3981: just as she'd always been, she tripped
3982: to meet the unhappy poet, skipped
3983: down from the porch, light as the lightest,
3984: the giddiest hope, carefree and gay,
3985: the same as any other day.
3986: {161}
3987: XIV
3988: ``Last night, what made you fly so early?''
3989: was the first thing that Olga said.
3990: All Lensky's thoughts went hurly-burly,
3991: and silently he hung his head.
3992: Rage died, and jealousy's obsession,
3993: before such candour of expression,
3994: such frank tendresse; away they stole
3995: before such playfulness of soul!...
3996: he looks, in sweet irresolution,
3997: and then concludes: she loves him yet!
3998: Already borne down by regret,
3999: he almost begs for absolution,
4000: he trembles, knows not what to tell;
4001: he's happy, yes, he's almost well...
4002: (XV, XVI,2) XVII
4003: Now brooding thoughts hold his attention
4004: once more, at that beloved sight,
4005: and so he lacks the strength to mention
4006: the happenings of the previous night;
4007: he murmurs: ``Olga's mine for saving;
4008: I'll stop that tempter from depraving
4009: her youth with all his repertoire
4010: of sighs, and compliments, and fire;
4011: that poisonous worm, despised, degrading,
4012: shall not attack my lily's root;
4013: I'll save this blossom on the shoot,
4014: still hardly opened up, from fading.''
4015: Friends, all this meant was: I've a date
4016: for swapping bullets with my mate.
4017: {162}
4018: XVIII
4019: If only Lensky'd known the burning
4020: wound that had seared my Tanya's heart!
4021: If Tanya'd had the chance of learning
4022: that Lensky and Eugene, apart,
4023: would settle, on the morrow morning,
4024: for which of them the tomb was yawning,
4025: perhaps her love could in the end
4026: have reunited friend to friend!
4027: But, even by accident, her passion
4028: was undiscovered to that day.
4029: Onegin had no word to say;
4030: Tatyana pined in secret fashion:
4031: of the whole world, her nurse alone,
4032: if not slow-witted, might have known.
4033: XIX
4034: Lensky all evening, in distraction,
4035: would talk, keep silent, laugh, then frown --
4036: the quintessential reaction
4037: of Muses' offspring; sitting down
4038: before the clavichord with knitted
4039: forehead, he strummed, his vision flitted
4040: to Olga's face, he whispered low
4041: ``I think I'm happy.'' Time to go,
4042: the hour was late. And now from aching
4043: the heart inside him seemed to shrink;
4044: parting with Olga made him think
4045: it was quite torn in half and breaking.
4046: She faced him, questioning: ``But you?...''
4047: ``It's nothing.'' And away he flew.
4048: {163}
4049: XX
4050: Once home, he brought out and inspected
4051: his pistols, laid them in their case,
4052: undressed, by candlelight selected
4053: and opened Schiller... but the embrace
4054: of one sole thought holds him in keeping
4055: and stops his doleful heart from sleeping:
4056: Olga is there, he sees her stand
4057: in untold beauty close at hand.
4058: Vladimir shuts the book, for writing
4059: prepares himself; and then his verse,
4060: compact of amorous trash, and worse,
4061: flows and reverberates. Reciting,
4062: he sounds, in lyric frenzy sunk,
4063: like Delvig3 when he's dining drunk.
4064: XXI
4065: By chance those verses haven't vanished;
4066: I keep them, and will quote them here:
4067: ``Whither, oh whither are ye banished,
4068: my golden days when spring was dear?
4069: What fate is my tomorrow brewing?
4070: the answer's past all human viewing,
4071: it's hidden deep in gloom and dust.
4072: No matter; fate's decree is just.
4073: Whether the arrow has my number,
4074: whether it goes careering past,
4075: all's well; the destined hour at last
4076: comes for awakening, comes for slumber;
4077: blessed are daytime's care and cark,
4078: blest is the advent of the dark!
4079: {164}
4080: XXII
4081: ``The morning star will soon be shining,
4082: and soon will day's bright tune be played;
4083: but I perhaps will be declining
4084: into the tomb's mysterious shade;
4085: the trail the youthful poet followed
4086: by sluggish Lethe may be swallowed,
4087: and I be by the world forgot;
4088: but, lovely maiden, wilt thou not
4089: on my untimely urn be weeping,
4090: thinking: he loved me, and in strife
4091: the sad beginnings of his life
4092: he consecrated to my keeping?...
4093: Friend of my heart, be at my side,
4094: beloved friend, thou art my bride!''
4095: XXIII
4096: So Lensky wrote, obscurely, limply
4097: (in the romantic style, we say,
4098: though what's romantic here I simply
4099: fail to perceive -- that's by the way).
4100: At last, with dawn upon him, stooping
4101: his weary head, and softly drooping
4102: over the modish word ideal,
4103: he dozed away; but when the real
4104: magic of sleep had started claiming
4105: its due oblivion, in the hush
4106: his neighbour entered at a rush
4107: and wakened Lensky by exclaiming:
4108: ``Get up: it's gone six! I'll be bound,
4109: Onegin's waiting on the ground.''
4110: {165}
4111: XXIV
4112: But he's mistaken: Eugene's lying
4113: and sleeping sounder than a rock.
4114: By now the shades of night are flying,
4115: Vesper is met by crow of cock --
4116: Onegin still is slumbering deeply.
4117: By now the sun is climbing steeply,
4118: and little dancing whirls of snow
4119: glitter and tumble as they go,
4120: but Eugene hasn't moved; for certain
4121: slumber still floats above his head.
4122: At last he wakes, and stirs in bed,
4123: and parts the fringes of his curtain;
4124: he looks, and sees the hour of day --
4125: high time he should be on his way.
4126: XXV
4127: He rings at once, and what a scurry!
4128: his French valet, Guillot, is there
4129: with gown and slippers; tearing hurry,
4130: as linen's brought for him to wear.
4131: And while with all despatch he's dressing
4132: he warns his man for duty, stressing
4133: that with him to the trysting-place
4134: he has to bring the battle-case.
4135: By now the sledge is at the portal --
4136: he's racing millward like a bird.
4137: Arrived apace, he gives the word
4138: to bring across Lepage's4 mortal
4139: barrels, and then to drive aside
4140: by two small oaktrees in a ride.
4141: {166}
4142: XXVI
4143: While Lensky'd long been meditating
4144: impatiently on the mill-dam,
4145: Zaretsky, engineer-in-waiting,
4146: condemned the millstones as a sham.
4147: Onegin comes, and makes excuses;
4148: but in Zaretsky he induces
4149: amazement: ``Where's your second gone?''
4150: In duels a pedantic don,
4151: methodical by disposition,
4152: a classicist, he'll not allow
4153: that one be shot just anyhow --
4154: only by rule, and strict tradition
4155: inherited from earlier days
4156: (for which he must receive due praise).
4157: XXVII
4158: Evgeny echoed him: ``My second?
4159: He's here -- Monsieur Guillot, my friend.
4160: I had most surely never reckoned
4161: his choice could shock or might offend;
4162: though he's unknown, there's no suggestion
4163: that he's not honest past all question.''
4164: Zaretsky bit his lip. Eugene
4165: asked Lensky: ``Should we start, I mean?''
4166: Vladimir to this casual mention
4167: replies: ``We might as well.'' They walk
4168: behind the mill. In solemn talk,
4169: Zaretsky draws up a convention
4170: with Guillot; while pourparlers last
4171: the two foes stand with eyes downcast.
4172: {167}
4173: XXVIII
4174: Foes! Is it long since from each other
4175: the lust for blood drew them apart?
4176: long since, like brother linked to brother,
4177: they shared their days in deed and heart,
4178: their table, and their hours of leisure?
4179: But now, in this vindictive pleasure
4180: hereditary foes they seem,
4181: and as in some appalling dream
4182: each coldly plans the other's slaughter...
4183: could they not laugh out loud, before
4184: their hands are dipped in scarlet gore,
4185: could they not give each other quarter
4186: and part in kindness? Just the same,
4187: all modish foes dread worldly shame.
4188: XXIX
4189: Pistols are out, they gleam, the hammer
4190: thumps as the balls are pressed inside
4191: faceted muzzles by the rammer;
4192: with a first click, the catch is tried.
4193: Now powder's greyish stream is slipping
4194: into the pan. Securely gripping,
4195: the jagged flint's pulled back anew.
4196: Guillot, behind a stump in view,
4197: stands in dismay and indecision.
4198: And now the two opponents doff
4199: their cloaks; Zaretsky's measured off
4200: thirty-two steps with great precision,
4201: and on their marks has made them stand;
4202: each grips his pistol in his hand.
4203: {168}
4204: XXX
4205: ``Now march.'' And calmly, not yet seeking
4206: to aim, at steady, even pace
4207: the foes, cold-blooded and unspeaking,
4208: each took four steps across the space,
4209: four fateful stairs. Then, without slowing
4210: the level tenor of his going,
4211: Evgeny quietly began
4212: to lift his pistol up. A span
4213: of five more steps they went, slow-gaited,
4214: and Lensky, left eye closing, aimed --
4215: but just then Eugene's pistol flamed...
4216: The clock of doom had struck as fated;
4217: and the poet, without a sound,
4218: let fall his pistol on the ground.
4219: XXXI
4220: Vladimir drops, hand softly sliding
4221: to heart. And in his misted gaze
4222: is death, not pain. So gently gliding
4223: down slopes of mountains, when a blaze
4224: of sunlight makes it flash and crumble,
4225: a block of snow will slip and tumble.
4226: Onegin, drenched with sudden chill,
4227: darts to the boy, and looks, and still
4228: calls out his name... All unavailing:
4229: the youthful votary of rhyme
4230: has found an end before his time.
4231: The storm is over,5 dawn is paling,
4232: the bloom has withered on the bough;
4233: the altar flame's extinguished now.
4234: {169}
4235: XXXII
4236: He lay quite still, and strange as dreaming
4237: was that calm brow of one who swooned.
4238: Shot through below the chest -- and streaming
4239: the blood came smoking from the wound.
4240: A moment earlier, inspiration
4241: had filled this heart, and detestation
4242: and hope and passion; life had glowed
4243: and blood had bubbled as it flowed;
4244: but now the mansion is forsaken;
4245: shutters are up, and all is pale
4246: and still within, behind the veil
4247: of chalk the window-panes have taken.
4248: The lady of the house has fled.
4249: Where to, God knows. The trail is dead.
4250: XXXIII
4251: With a sharp epigram it's pleasant
4252: to infuriate a clumsy foe;
4253: and, as observer, to be present
4254: and watch him stubbornly bring low
4255: his thrusting horns, and as he passes
4256: blush to descry in looking-glasses
4257: his foolish face; more pleasant yet
4258: to hear him howl: ``that's me!'' You'll get
4259: more joy still when with mute insistence
4260: you help him to an honoured fate
4261: by calmly aiming at his pate
4262: from any gentlemanly distance;
4263: but when you've managed his despatch
4264: you won't find that quite so much catch...
4265: {170}
4266: XXXIV
4267: What if your pistol-shot has smitten
4268: a friend of yours in his first youth
4269: because some glance of his has bitten
4270: your pride, some answer, or in truth
4271: some nonsense thrown up while carousing,
4272: or if himself, with rage arousing,
4273: he's called you out -- say, in your soul
4274: what feelings would assume control
4275: if, motionless, no life appearing,
4276: death on his brow, your friend should lie,
4277: stiffening as the hours go by,
4278: before you on the ground, unhearing,
4279: unspeaking, too, but stretched out there
4280: deaf to the voice of your despair?
4281: XXXV
4282: Giving his pistol-butt a squeezing,
4283: Evgeny looks at Lensky, chilled
4284: at heart by grim remorse's freezing.
4285: ``Well, what?'' the neighbour says, ``he's killed.''
4286: Killed!... At this frightful word a-quiver,
4287: Onegin turns, and with a shiver
4288: summons his people. On the sleigh
4289: with care Zaretsky stows away
4290: the frozen corpse, drives off, and homing
4291: vanishes with his load of dread.
4292: The horses, as they sense the dead,
4293: have snorted, reared, and whitely foaming
4294: have drenched the steel bit as they go
4295: and flown like arrows from a bow.
4296: {171}
4297: XXXVI
4298: My friends, the bard stirs your compassion:
4299: right in the flower of joyous hope,
4300: hope that he's had no time to fashion
4301: for men to see, still in the scope
4302: of swaddling clothes -- already blighted!
4303: Where is the fire that once ignited,
4304: where's the high aim, the ardent sense
4305: of youth, so tender, so intense?
4306: and where is love's tempestuous yearning,
4307: where are the reveries this time,
4308: the horror of disgrace and crime,
4309: the thirst for work, the lust for learning,
4310: and life celestial's phantom gleams,
4311: stuff of the poet's hallowed dreams!
4312: XXXVII
4313: Perhaps to improve the world's condition,
4314: perhaps for fame, he was endowed;
4315: his lyre, now stilled, in its high mission
4316: might have resounded long and loud
4317: for aeons. Maybe it was fated
4318: that on the world's staircase there waited
4319: for him a lofty stair. His shade,
4320: after the martyr's price it paid,
4321: maybe bore off with it for ever
4322: a secret truth, and at our cost
4323: a life-creating voice was lost;
4324: to it the people's blessing never
4325: will reach, and past the tomb's compound
4326: hymns of the ages never sound.
4327: {172}
4328: (XXXVIII,2) XXXIX
4329: Perhaps however, to be truthful,
4330: he would have found a normal fate.
4331: The years would pass; no longer youthful,
4332: he'd see his soul cool in its grate;
4333: his nature would be changed and steadied,
4334: he'd sack the Muses and get wedded;
4335: and in the country, blissful, horned,
4336: in quilted dressing-gown adorned,
4337: life's real meaning would have found him;
4338: at forty he'd have got the gout,
4339: drunk, eaten, yawned, grown weak and stout,
4340: at length, midst children swarming round him,
4341: midst crones with endless tears to shed,
4342: and doctors, he'd have died in bed.
4343: XL
4344: Reader, whatever fate's direction,
4345: we weep for the young lover's end,
4346: the man of reverie and reflection,
4347: the poet struck down by his friend!
4348: Left-handed from the habitation
4349: where dwelt this child of inspiration,
4350: two pines have tangled at the root;
4351: beneath, a brook rolls its tribute
4352: toward the neighbouring valley's river.
4353: The ploughman there delights to doze,
4354: girl reapers as the streamlet flows
4355: dip in their jugs; where shadows quiver
4356: darkly above the water's lilt,
4357: a simple monument is built.
4358: {173}
4359: XLI
4360: Below it, when sprang rains are swishing,
4361: when, on the plain, green herbs are massed,
4362: the shepherd sings of Volga's fishing
4363: and plaits a piebald shoe of bast;
4364: and the young city-bred newcomer,
4365: who in the country spends her summer,
4366: when galloping at headlong pace
4367: alone across the fields of space,
4368: will halt her horse and, gripping tightly
4369: the leather rein, to learn the tale,
4370: lift up the gauzes of her veil,
4371: with a quick look perusing lightly
4372: the simple legend -- then a haze
4373: of tears will cloud her tender gaze.
4374: XLII
4375: Walking her horse in introspection
4376: across the plain's enormous room,
4377: what holds her in profound reflection,
4378: despite herself, is Lensky's doom;
4379: ``Olga,'' she thinks, ``what fate befell her?
4380: her heartache, did it long compel her,
4381: or did her grief soon find repair?
4382: and where's her sister now? and where,
4383: flown from society as we know it,
4384: of modish belles the modish foe,
4385: where did that glum eccentric go,
4386: the one who killed the youthful poet?''
4387: All in good time, on each point I
4388: will give you a complete reply.
4389: {174}
4390: XLIII
4391: But not today. Although I dearly
4392: value the hero of my tale,
4393: though I'll come back to him, yet clearly
4394: to face him now I feel too frail...
4395: The years incline to gloom and prosing,
4396: they kill the zest of rhymed composing,
4397: and with a sigh I now admit
4398: I have to drag my feet to it.
4399: My pen, as once, no longer hurries
4400: to spoil loose paper by the ream;
4401: another, a more chilling dream,
4402: and other, more exacting worries,
4403: in fashion's din, at still of night,
4404: come to disturb me and affright.
4405: XLIV
4406: I've learnt the voice of new ambition,
4407: I've learnt new sadness; but in this
4408: the first will never find fruition,
4409: the earlier griefs are what I miss.
4410: O dreams, o dreams, where is your sweetness?
4411: where (standard rhyme) are youth and fleetness?
4412: can it be true, their crown at last
4413: has felt time's desiccating blast?
4414: can it be true, and firmly stated
4415: without an elegiac frill,
4416: that spring with me has had its fill
4417: (as I've so oft in jest related)?
4418: Can it be true, it won't come twice --
4419: and I'll be thirty in a trice?
4420: {175}
4421: XLV
4422: Well, I must make a frank confession,
4423: my noon is here, and that's the truth.
4424: So let me with a kind expression
4425: take leave of my lightheaded youth!
4426: Thank you for all the gifts I treasure,
4427: thank you for sorrow and for pleasure,
4428: thank you for suffering and its joys,
4429: for tempests and for feasts and noise;
4430: thank you indeed. Alike in sorrow
4431: and in flat calm I've found the stuff
4432: of perfect bliss in you. Enough!
4433: My soul's like crystal, and tomorrow
4434: I shall set out on brand-new ways
4435: and rest myself from earlier days.
4436: XLVI
4437: Let me look back. Farewell, umbrageous
4438: forests where my young age was passed
4439: in indolence and in rampageous
4440: passion and dreams of pensive cast.
4441: But come, thou youthful inspiration,
4442: come, trouble my imagination,
4443: liven the drowsing of my heart,
4444: fly to my corner like a dart,
4445: let not the poet's soul of passion
4446: grow cold, and hard, and stiff as stock,
4447: and finally be turned to rock
4448: amid the deadening joys of fashion,
4449: < amongst the soulless men of pride,
4450: the fools who sparkle far and wide,6
4451: {176}
4452: XLVII
4453: amongst the crafty and small-minded,
4454: the children spoilt, the mad, the rogues
4455: both dull and ludicrous, the bunded
4456: critics and their capricious vogues,
4457: amongst devout coquettes, appalling
4458: lickspittles who adore their crawling,
4459: and daily scenes of modish life
4460: where civil treacheries are rife,
4461: urbane betrayals, and the chilling
4462: verdicts of vanity the bleak,
4463: men's thoughts, their plots, the words they speak,
4464: all of an emptiness so killing -- >
4465: that's the morass, I beg you note,
4466: in which, dear friends, we're all afloat!
4467: {177}
4468: Notes to Chapter Six
4469: 1 Café-restaurant in Paris.
4470: 2 Stanzas XV, XVI and XXXVIII were discarded by Pushkin.
4471: 3 Anton Delvig, poet and close friend of Pushkin.
4472: 4 Jean Lepage, Parisian gunsmith.
4473: 5  ``A  deliberate  accumulation of  conventional poetical  formulae by
4474: means of  which Pushkin mimics  poor Lensky's own style... but  the rich and
4475: original  metaphor  of the deserted house, closed  inner shutters,  whitened
4476: window-panes, departed  female owner (the soul being  feminine  in Russian),
4477: with which XXXII ends, is Pushkin's own contribution, a sample as it were of
4478: what he can do.'' Nabokov.
4479: 6 These lines and the first twelve lines of stanza XLVII were discarded
4480: by Pushkin.
4481: --------
4482: Chapter Seven
4483: Moscow, loved daughter of Russia,
4484: where can we find your equal?
4485: Dmitriev
4486: ``How can one not love mother Moscow?''
4487: Baratynsky
4488: ``You criticize Moscow? why make such a fuss
4489: of seeing the world? what on earth could be better?''
4490: ``A place where you'll find none of us.''
4491: Griboedov
4492: I
4493: By now the rays of spring are chasing
4494: the snow from all surrounding hills;
4495: it melts, away it rushes, racing
4496: down to the plain in turbid rills.
4497: Smiling through sleep, nature is meeting
4498: the infant year with cheerful greeting:
4499: the sky is brilliant in its blue
4500: and, still transparent to the view,
4501: the downy woods are greener-tinted;
4502: from waxen cell the bees again
4503: levy their tribute on the plain;
4504: the vales dry out, grow brightly printed;
4505: cows low, in the still nights of spring
4506: the nightingale's begun to sing.
4507: {178}
4508: II
4509: O spring! o time for love! how sadly
4510: your advent swamps me in its flood!
4511: and in my soul, o spring, how madly
4512: your presence aches, and in my blood!
4513: How heavy, and how near to sobbing,
4514: the bliss that fills me when your throbbing,
4515: caressing breath has fanned my face
4516: in rural calm's most secret place!
4517: Or from all notion of enjoyment
4518: am I estranged, does all that cheers,
4519: that lives, and glitters, and endears,
4520: now crush with sorrow's dull deployment
4521: a soul that perished long ago,
4522: and finds the world a darkling show?
4523: III
4524: Or, unconsoled by the returning
4525: of leaves that autumn killed for good,
4526: are we recalled to grief still burning
4527: by the new whisper in the wood?
4528: or else does nature, fresh and staring,
4529: set off our troubled mind comparing
4530: its newness with our faded days,
4531: with years no more to meet our gaze?
4532: Perhaps, when thoughts are all a-quiver
4533: in midst of a poetic dream,
4534: some other, older spring will gleam,
4535: and put our heart into a shiver
4536: with visions of enchanted night,
4537: of distant countries, of moonlight...
4538: {179}
4539: IV
4540: It's time: kind-hearted, idle creatures,
4541: dons of Epicurean rule,
4542: calm men with beatific features,
4543: graduates of the Levshin1 school,
4544: Priam-like agricultural sages,
4545: sensitive ladies of all ages --
4546: the spring invites you to the land
4547: now warmth and blossom are on hand,
4548: field-work, and walks with inspiration,
4549: and magic nights. In headlong course
4550: come to the fields, my friends! To horse!
4551: With mounts from home, or postal station,
4552: in loaded carriages, migrate,
4553: leave far behind that city-gate.
4554: V
4555: Forsake, indulgent reader -- driven
4556: in your calèche of foreign cast --
4557: the untiring city, where you've given
4558: to feasts and fun this winter past;
4559: and though my muse may be capricious,
4560: we'll go with her to that delicious
4561: and nameless rivulet, that scene
4562: of whispering woods where my Eugene,
4563: an idle monk in glum seclusion,
4564: has lately wintered, just a space
4565: from young Tatyana's dwelling-place,
4566: dear Tanya, lover of illusion;
4567: though there he's no more to be found,
4568: he's left sad footprints on the ground.
4569: {180}
4570: VI
4571: Amidst the hills, down in that valley,
4572: let's go where, winding all the time
4573: across green meadows, dilly-dally,
4574: a brook flows through a grove of lime.
4575: There sings the nightingale, spring's lover,
4576: the wild rose blooms, and in the covert
4577: the source's chattering voice is heard;
4578: and there a tombstone says its word
4579: where two old pinetrees stand united:
4580: ``This is Vladimir Lensky's grave
4581: who early died as die the brave'' --
4582: the headpiece-text is thus indited --
4583: the year, his age, then: ``may your rest,
4584: young poet, be for ever blest!''
4585: VII
4586: There was a pine-branch downward straying
4587: towards the simple urn beneath;
4588: time was when morning's breeze was swaying
4589: over it a mysterious wreath:
4590: time was, in evening hours of leisure,
4591: by moonlight two young girls took pleasure,
4592: closely embraced, in wending here,
4593: to see the grave, and shed a tear.
4594: Today... the sad memorial's lonely,
4595: forgot. Its trodden path is now
4596: choked up. There's no wreath on the bough;
4597: grey-haired and weak, beneath it only
4598: the shepherd, as he used to do,
4599: sings as he plaits a humble shoe.
4600: {181}
4601: (VIII,2 IX,) X
4602: Poor Lensky! Set aside for weeping,
4603: or pining, Olga's hours were brief.
4604: Alas for him! there was no keeping
4605: his sweetheart faithful to her grief.
4606: Another had the skill to ravish
4607: her thoughts away, knew how to lavish
4608: sweet words by which her pain was banned --
4609: a Lancer wooed and won her hand,
4610: a Lancer -- how she deified him!
4611: and at the altar, with a crown,
4612: her head in modesty cast down,
4613: already there she stands beside him;
4614: her eyes are lowered, but ablaze,
4615: and on her lips a light smile plays.
4616: XI
4617: Poor Lensky! where the tomb is bounded
4618: by dull eternity's purlieus,
4619: was the sad poet not confounded
4620: at this betrayal's fateful news?
4621: Or, as by Lethe's bank he slumbered,
4622: perhaps no more sensations lumbered
4623: the lucky bard, and as he dozed
4624: the earth for him grew dumb and closed?...
4625: On such indifference, such forgetting
4626: beyond the grave we all must build --
4627: foes, friends and loves, their voice is stilled.
4628: Only the estate provides a setting
4629: for angry heirs, as one, to fall
4630: into an unbecoming brawl.
4631: {182}
4632: XII
4633: Presently Olga's ringing answer
4634: inside the Larins' house fell mute.
4635: Back to his regiment the Lancer,
4636: slave of the service, was en route.
4637: Weltered in tears, and sorely smarting,
4638: the old dame wept her daughter's parting,
4639: and in her grief seemed fit to die;
4640: but Tanya found she couldn't cry:
4641: only the pallor of heart-breaking
4642: covered her face. When all came out
4643: onto the porch, and fussed about
4644: over the business of leave-taking,
4645: Tatyana went with them, and sped
4646: the carriage of the newly-wed.
4647: XIII
4648: And long, as if through mists that spurted,
4649: Tanya pursued them with her gaze...
4650: So there she stood, forlorn, deserted!
4651: The comrade of so many days,
4652: oh! her young dove, the natural hearer
4653: of secrets, like a friend but dearer,
4654: had been for ever borne off far
4655: and parted from her by their star.
4656: Shade-like, in purposeless obsession
4657: she roams the empty garden-plot...
4658: in everything she sees there's not
4659: a grain of gladness; tears' repression
4660: allows no comfort to come through --
4661: Tatyana's heart is rent in two.
4662: {183}
4663: XIV
4664: Her passion burns with stronger powder
4665: now she's bereft, and just the same
4666: her heart speaks to her even louder
4667: of far-away Onegin's name.
4668: She'll not see him, her obligation
4669: must be to hold in detestation
4670: the man who laid her brother low.
4671: The poet's dead... already though
4672: no one recalls him or his verses;
4673: by now his bride-to-be has wed
4674: another, and his memory's fled
4675: as smoke in azure sky disperses.
4676: Two hearts there are perhaps that keep
4677: a tear for him... but what's to weep?
4678: XV
4679: Evening, and darkening sky, and waters
4680: in quiet flood. A beetle whirred.
4681: The choirs of dancers sought their quarters.
4682: Beyond the stream there smoked and stirred
4683: a fisher's fire. Through country gleaming
4684: silver with moonlight, in her dreaming
4685: profoundly sunk, Tatyana stalked
4686: for hours alone; she walked and walked...
4687: Suddenly, from a crest, she sighted
4688: a house, a village, and a wood
4689: below a hill; a garden stood
4690: above a stream the moon had lighted.
4691: She looked across, felt in her heart
4692: a faster, stronger pulsing start.
4693: {184}
4694: XVI
4695: She hesitates, and doubts beset her:
4696: forward or back? it's true that he
4697: has left, and no one here has met her...
4698: ``The house, the park... I'll go and see!''
4699: So down came Tanya, hardly daring
4700: to draw a breath, around her staring
4701: with puzzled and confused regard...
4702: She entered the deserted yard.
4703: Dogs, howling, rushed in her direction...
4704: Her frightened cry brought running out
4705: the household boys in noisy rout;
4706: giving the lady their protection,
4707: by dint of cuff and kick and smack
4708: they managed to disperse the pack.
4709: XVII
4710: ``Could I just see the house, I wonder?''
4711: Tatyana asked. The children all
4712: rushed to Anisia's room, to plunder
4713: the keys that opened up the hall.
4714: At once Anisia came to greet her,
4715: the doorway opened wide to meet her,
4716: she went inside the empty shell
4717: in which our hero used to dwell.
4718: She looks: forgotten past all chalking
4719: on billiard-table rests a cue,
4720: and on the crumpled sofa too
4721: a riding whip. Tanya keeps walking...
4722: ``And here's the hearth,'' explains the crone,
4723: ``where master used to sit alone.
4724: {185}
4725: XVIII
4726: ``Here in the winter he'd have dinner
4727: with neighbour Lensky, the deceased.
4728: Please follow me. And here's the inner
4729: study where he would sleep and feast
4730: on cups of coffee, and then later
4731: he'd listen to the administrator;
4732: in morning time he'd read a book...
4733: And just here, in the window-nook,
4734: is where old master took up station,
4735: and put his glasses on to see
4736: his Sunday game of cards with me.
4737: I pray God grant his soul salvation,
4738: and rest his dear bones in the tomb,
4739: down in our damp earth-mother's womb!''
4740: XIX
4741: Tatyana in a deep emotion
4742: gazes at all the scene around;
4743: she drinks it like a priceless potion;
4744: it stirs her drooping soul to bound
4745: in fashion that's half-glad, half-anguished:
4746: that table where the lamp has languished,
4747: beside the window-sill, that bed
4748: on which a carpet has been spread,
4749: piled books, and through the pane the sable
4750: moonscape, the half-light overall,
4751: Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
4752: the iron figure3 on the table,
4753: the hat, the scowling brow, the chest
4754: where folded arms are tightly pressed.
4755: {186}
4756: XX
4757: Longtime inside this modish cloister,
4758: as if spellbound, Tatyana stands.
4759: It's late. A breeze begins to roister,
4760: the valley's dark. The forest lands
4761: round the dim river sleep; the curtain
4762: of hills has hid the moon; for certain
4763: the time to go has long since passed
4764: for the young pilgrim. So at last
4765: Tatyana, hiding her condition,
4766: and not without a sigh, perforce
4767: sets out upon her homeward course;
4768: before she goes, she seeks permission
4769: to come back to the hall alone
4770: and read the books there on her own.
4771: XXI
4772: Outside the gate Tatyana parted
4773: with old Anisia. The next day
4774: at earliest morning out she started,
4775: to the empty homestead made her way,
4776: then in the study's quiet setting,
4777: at last alone, and quite forgetting
4778: the world and all its works, she wept
4779: and sat there as the minutes crept;
4780: the books then underwent inspection...
4781: at first she had no heart to range;
4782: but then she found their choice was strange.
4783: To reading from this odd collection
4784: Tatyana turned with thirsting soul:
4785: and watched a different world unroll.
4786: {187}
4787: XXII
4788: Though long since Eugene's disapproval
4789: had ruled out reading, in their place
4790: and still exempted from removal
4791: a few books had escaped disgrace:
4792: Don Juan's and the Giaour's creator,
4793: two or three novels where our later
4794: epoch's portrayed, survived the ban,
4795: works where contemporary man
4796: is represented rather truly,
4797: that soul without a moral tie,
4798: all egoistical and dry,
4799: to dreaming given up unduly,
4800: and that embittered mind which boils
4801: in empty deeds and futile toils.
4802: XXIII
4803: There many pages keep the impression
4804: where a sharp nail has made a dent.
4805: On these, with something like obsession,
4806: the girl's attentive eyes are bent.
4807: Tatyana sees with trepidation
4808: what kind of thought, what observation,
4809: had drawn Eugene's especial heed
4810: and where he'd silently agreed.
4811: Her eyes along the margin flitting
4812: pursue his pencil. Everywhere
4813: Onegin's soul encountered there
4814: declares itself in ways unwitting --
4815: terse words or crosses in the book,
4816: or else a query's wondering hook.
4817: {188}
4818: XXIV
4819: And so, at last, feature by feature,
4820: Tanya begins to understand
4821: more thoroughly, thank God, the creature
4822: for whom her passion has been planned
4823: by fate's decree: this freakish stranger,
4824: who walks with sorrow, and with danger,
4825: whether from heaven or from hell,
4826: this angel, this proud devil, tell,
4827: what is he? Just an apparition,
4828: a shadow, null and meaningless,
4829: a Muscovite in Harold's dress,
4830: a modish second-hand edition,
4831: a glossary of smart argot...
4832: a parodistic raree-show?
4833: XXV
4834: Can she have found the enigma's setting?
4835: is this the riddle's missing clue?
4836: Time races, and she's been forgetting
4837: her journey home is overdue.
4838: Some neighbours there have come together;
4839: they talk of her, of how and whether:
4840: ``Tanya's no child -- it's past a joke,''
4841: says the old lady in a croak:
4842: ``why, Olga's younger, and she's bedded.
4843: It's time she went. But what can I
4844: do with her when a flat reply
4845: always comes back: I'll not be wedded.
4846: And then she broods and mopes for good,
4847: and trails alone around the wood.''
4848: {189}
4849: XXVI
4850: ``She's not in love?'' ``There's no one, ever.
4851: Buyánov tried -- got flea in ear.
4852: And Ivan Petushkóv; no, never.
4853: Pikhtín, of the Hussars, was here;
4854: he found Tatyana so attractive,
4855: bestirred himself, was devilish active!
4856: I thought, she'll go this time, perhaps;
4857: far from it! just one more collapse.''
4858: ``You don't see what to do? that's funny:
4859: Moscow's the place, the marriage-fair!
4860: There's vacancies in plenty there.''
4861: ``My dear good sir, I'm short of money.''
4862: ``One winter's worth, you've surely got;
4863: or borrow, say, from me, if not.''
4864: XXVII
4865: The old dame had no thought of scouring
4866: such good and sensible advice;
4867: accounts were done, a winter outing
4868: to Moscow settled in a trice.
4869: Then Tanya hears of the decision.
4870: To face society's derision
4871: with the unmistakeable sideview
4872: of a provincial ingénue,
4873: to expose to Moscow fops and Circes
4874: her out-of-fashion turns of phrase,
4875: parade before their mocking gaze
4876: her out-of-fashion clothes!... oh, mercies!
4877: no, forests are the sole retreat
4878: where her security's complete.
4879: {190}
4880: XXVIII
4881: Risen with earliest rays of dawning,
4882: Tanya today goes hurrying out
4883: into the fields, surveys the morning,
4884: with deep emotion looks about
4885: and says: ``Farewell, you vales and fountains!
4886: farewell you too, familiar mountains!
4887: Farewell, familiar woods! Farewell,
4888: beauty with all its heavenly spell,
4889: gay nature and its sparkling distance!
4890: This dear, still world I must forswear
4891: for vanity, and din, and glare!...
4892: Farewell to you, my free existence!
4893: whither does all my yearning tend?
4894: my fate, it leads me to what end?''
4895: XXIX
4896: She wanders on without direction.
4897: Often she halts against her will,
4898: arrested by the sheer perfection
4899: she finds in river and in hill.
4900: As with old friends, she craves diversion
4901: in gossip's rambling and discursion
4902: with her own forests and her meads...
4903: But the swift summer-time proceeds --
4904: now golden autumn's just arriving.
4905: Now Nature's tremulous, pale effect
4906: suggests a victim richly decked...
4907: The north wind blows, the clouds are driving --
4908: amidst the howling and the blast
4909: sorceress-winter's here at last.
4910: {191}
4911: XXX
4912: She's here, she spreads abroad; she stipples
4913: the branches of the oak with flock;
4914: lies in a coverlet that ripples
4915: across the fields, round hill and rock;
4916: the bank, the immobile stream are levelled
4917: beneath a shroud that's all dishevelled;
4918: frost gleams. We watch with gleeful thanks
4919: old mother winter at her pranks.
4920: Only from Tanya's heart, no cheering --
4921: for her, no joy from winter-time,
4922: she won't inhale the powdered rime,
4923: nor from the bath-house roof be clearing
4924: first snow for shoulders, breast and head:
4925: for Tanya, winter's ways are dread.
4926: XXXI
4927: Departure date's long overtaken;
4928: at last the final hours arrive.
4929: A sledded coach, for years forsaken,
4930: relined and strengthened for the drive;
4931: three carts -- traditional procession --
4932: with every sort of home possession:
4933: pans, mattresses, and trunks, and chairs,
4934: and jam in jars, and household wares,
4935: and feather-beds, and birds in cages,
4936: with pots and basins out of mind,
4937: and useful goods of every kind.
4938: There's din of parting now that rages,
4939: with tears, in quarters of the maids:
4940: and, in the yard, stand eighteen jades.
4941: {192}
4942: XXXII
4943: Horses and coach are spliced in marriage;
4944: the cooks prepare the midday meal;
4945: mountains are piled on every carriage,
4946: and coachmen swear, and women squeal.
4947: The bearded outrider is sitting
4948: his spindly, shaggy nag. As fitting,
4949: to wave farewell the household waits
4950: for the two ladies at the gates.
4951: They're settled in; and crawling, sliding,
4952: the grand barouche is on its way.
4953: ``Farewell, you realms that own the sway
4954: of solitude, and peace abiding!
4955: shall I see you?'' As Tanya speaks
4956: the tears in stream pour down her cheeks.
4957: XXXIII
4958: When progress and amelioration
4959: have pushed their frontiers further out,
4960: in time (to quote the calculation
4961: of philosophic brains, about
4962: five hundred years) for sure our byways
4963: will blossom into splendid highways:
4964: paved roads will traverse Russia's length
4965: bringing her unity and strength;
4966: and iron bridges will go arching
4967: over the waters in a sweep;
4968: mountains will part; below the deep,
4969: audacious tunnels will be marching:
4970: Godfearing folk will institute
4971: an inn at each stage of the route.
4972: {193}
4973: XXXIV
4974: But now our roads are bad, the ages
4975: have gnawed our bridges, and the flea
4976: and bedbug that infest the stages
4977: allow no rest to you or me;
4978: inns don't exist; but in a freezing
4979: log cabin a pretentious-teasing
4980: menu, hung up for show, excites
4981: all sorts of hopeless appetites;
4982: meanwhile the local Cyclops, aiming
4983: a Russian hammer-blow, repairs
4984: Europe's most finely chiselled wares
4985: before a fire too slowly flaming,
4986: and blesses the unrivalled brand
4987: of ruts that grace our fatherland.
4988: XXXV
4989: By contrast, in the frozen season,
4990: how pleasantly the stages pass.
4991: Like modish rhymes that lack all reason,
4992: the winter's ways are smooth as glass.
4993: Then our Automedons are flashing,
4994: our troikas effortlessly dashing,
4995: and mileposts grip the idle sense
4996: by flickering past us like a fence.
4997: Worse luck, Larina crawled; the employment
4998: of her own horses, not the post,
4999: spared her the expense she dreaded most --
5000: and gave our heroine enjoyment
5001: of traveller's tedium at its peak:
5002: their journey took them a full week.
5003: {194}
5004: XXXVI
5005: But now they're near. Already gleaming
5006: before their eyes they see unfold
5007: the towers of whitestone Moscow beaming
5008: with fire from every cross of gold.
5009: Friends, how my heart would leap with pleasure
5010: when suddenly I saw this treasure
5011: of spires and belfries, in a cup
5012: with parks and mansions, open up.
5013: How often would I fall to musing
5014: of Moscow in the mournful days
5015: of absence on my wandering ways!
5016: Moscow... how many strains are fusing
5017: in that one sound, for Russian hearts!
5018: what store of riches it imparts!
5019: XXXVII
5020: Here stands, with shady park surrounded,
5021: Petrovsky Castle; and the fame
5022: in which so lately it abounded
5023: rings proudly in that sombre name.
5024: Napoleon here, intoxicated
5025: with recent fortune, vainly waited
5026: till Moscow, meekly on its knees,
5027: gave up the ancient Kremlin-keys:
5028: but no, my Moscow never stumbled
5029: nor crawled in suppliant attire.
5030: No feast, no welcome-gifts -- with fire
5031: the impatient conqueror was humbled!
5032: From here, deep-sunk in pensive woe,
5033: he gazed out on the threatening glow.
5034: {195}
5035: XXXVIII
5036: Farewell, Petrovsky Castle, glimmer
5037: of fallen glory. Well! don't wait,
5038: drive on! And now we see a-shimmer
5039: the pillars of the turnpike-gate;
5040: along Tverskaya Street already
5041: the potholes make the coach unsteady.
5042: Street lamps go flashing by, and stalls,
5043: boys, country women, stately halls,
5044: parks, monasteries, towers and ledges,
5045: Bokharans, orchards, merchants, shacks,
5046: boulevards, chemists, and Cossacks,
5047: peasants, and fashion-shops, and sledges,
5048: lions adorning gateway posts
5049: and, on the crosses, jackdaw hosts.
5050: (XXXIX,2) XL
5051: This wearisome perambulation
5052: takes up an hour or two; at last
5053: the coach has reached its destination;
5054: after Saint Chariton's gone past
5055: a mansion stands just round a turning.
5056: On an old aunt, who's long been burning
5057: with a consumption, they've relied.
5058: And now the door is opened wide,
5059: a grizzled Calmuck stands to meet them,
5060: bespectacled, in tattered dress;
5061: and from the salon the princess,
5062: stretched on a sofa, calls to greet them.
5063: The two old ladies kiss and cry;
5064: thickly the exclamations fly.
5065: {196}
5066: XLI
5067: ``Princess, mon ange!'' ``Pachette!'' ``Alina!''
5068: ``Who would have thought it?'' ``What an age!''
5069: ``How long can you... ?'' ``Dearest kuzina!''
5070: ``Sit down! how strange! it's like the stage
5071: or else a novel.'' ``And my daughter
5072: Tatyana's here, you know I've brought her...''
5073: ``Ah, Tanya, come to me, it seems
5074: I'm wandering in a world of dreams...
5075: Grandison, cousin, d'you remember?''
5076: ``What, Grandison? oh, Grandison!
5077: I do, I do. Well, where's he gone?''
5078: ``Here, near Saint Simeon; in December,
5079: on Christmas Eve, he wished me joy:
5080: lately he married off his boy.''
5081: XLII
5082: ``As for the other one... tomorrow
5083: we'll talk, and talk, and then we'll show
5084: Tanya to all her kin. My sorrow
5085: is that my feet lack strength to go
5086: outside the house. But you'll be aching
5087: after your drive, it's quite back-breaking;
5088: let's go together, take a rest...
5089: Oh, I've no strength... I'm tired, my chest...
5090: These days I'm finding even gladness,
5091: not only pain, too much to meet...
5092: I'm good for nothing now, my sweet...
5093: you age, and life's just grief and sadness...''
5094: With that, in tears, and quite worn out,
5095: she burst into a coughing-bout.
5096: {197}
5097: XLIII
5098: The invalid's glad salutation,
5099: her kindness, move Tatyana; yet
5100: the strangeness of her habitation,
5101: after her own room, makes her fret.
5102: No sleep, beneath that silken curtain,
5103: in that new couch, no sleep for certain;
5104: the early pealing of the bells
5105: lifts her from bed as it foretells
5106: the occupations of the morning.
5107: She sits down by the window-sill.
5108: The darkness thins away; but still
5109: no vision of her fields is dawning.
5110: An unknown yard, she sees from thence,
5111: a stall, a kitchen and a fence.
5112: XLIV
5113: The kinsfolk in concerted action
5114: ask Tanya out to dine, and they
5115: present her languor and distraction
5116: to fresh grandparents every day.
5117: For cousins from afar, on meeting
5118: there never fails a kindly greeting,
5119: and exclamations, and good cheer.
5120: ``How Tanya's grown! I pulled your ear
5121: just yesterday.'' ``And since your christening
5122: how long is it?'' ``And since I fed
5123: you in my arms on gingerbread?''
5124: And all grandmothers who are listening
5125: in unison repeat the cry:
5126: ``My goodness, how the years do fly!''
5127: {198}
5128: XLV
5129: Their look, though, shows no change upon it --
5130: they all still keep their old impress:
5131: still made of tulle, the self-same bonnet
5132: adorns Aunt Helen, the princess;
5133: still powdered is Lukérya Lvovna,
5134: a liar still, Lyubóv Petrovna,
5135: Iván Petróvich still is dumb,
5136: Semyón Petróvich, mean and glum,
5137: and then old cousin Pelagéya
5138: still has Monsieur Finemouche for friend,
5139: same Pom, same husband to the end;
5140: he's at the club, a real stayer,
5141: still meek, still deaf as howd'youdo,
5142: still eats and drinks enough for two.
5143: XLVI
5144: And in their daughters' close embraces
5145: Tanya is gripped. No comment's made
5146: at first by Moscow's youthful graces
5147: while she's from top to toe surveyed;
5148: they find her somewhat unexpected,
5149: a bit provincial and affected,
5150: too pale, too thin, but on the whole
5151: not bad at all; and then each soul
5152: gives way to nature's normal passion:
5153: she's their great friend, asked in, caressed,
5154: her hands affectionately pressed;
5155: they fluff her curls out in the fashion,
5156: and in a singsong voice confide
5157: the inmost thoughts that girls can hide.
5158: {199}
5159: XLVII
5160: Each others' and their own successes,
5161: their hopes, their pranks, their dreams at night --
5162: and so the harmless chat progresses
5163: coated with a thin layer of spite.
5164: Then in return for all this twaddle,
5165: from her they strive to coax and coddle
5166: a full confession of the heart.
5167: Tatyana hears but takes no part;
5168: as if she'd been profoundly sleeping,
5169: there's not a word she's understood;
5170: she guards, in silence and for good,
5171: her sacred store of bliss and weeping
5172: as something not to be declared,
5173: a treasure never to be shared.
5174: XLVIII
5175: To talk, to general conversation
5176: Tatyana seeks to attune her ear,
5177: but the salon's preoccupation
5178: is with dull trash that can't cohere:
5179: everything's dim and unenthusing;
5180: even the scandal's not amusing;
5181: in talk, so fruitless and so stale,
5182: in question, gossip, news and tale,
5183: not once a day a thought will quiver,
5184: not even by chance, once in a while,
5185: will the benighted reason smile,
5186: even in joke the heart won't shiver.
5187: This world's so vacuous that it's got
5188: no spark of fun in all its rot!
5189: {200}
5190: XLIX
5191: In swarms around Tatyana ranging,
5192: the modish Record Office clerks
5193: stare hard at her before exchanging
5194: some disagreeable remarks.
5195: One melancholy fop, declaring
5196: that she's ``ideal'', begins preparing
5197: an elegy to her address,
5198: propped in the door among the press.
5199: Once Vyázemsky,4 who chanced to find her
5200: at some dull aunt's, sat down and knew
5201: how to engage in talk that drew
5202: her soul's attention; just behind her
5203: an old man saw her as she came,
5204: straightened his wig, and asked her name.
5205: L
5206: But where, mid tragic storms that rend her,
5207: Melpomene wails long and loud,
5208: and brandishes her tinsel splendour
5209: before a cold, indifferent crowd,
5210: and where Thalia, gently napping,
5211: ignores approval's friendly clapping,
5212: and where Terpsichore alone
5213: moves the young watcher (as was known
5214: to happen long ago, dear readers,
5215: in our first ages), from no place
5216: did any glasses seek her face,
5217: lorgnettes of jealous fashion-leaders,
5218: or quizzing-glasses of know-alls
5219: in boxes or the rows of stalls.
5220: {201}
5221: LI
5222: They take her too to the Assembly.
5223: The crush, the heat, as music blares,
5224: the blaze of candles, and the trembly
5225: flicker of swiftly twirling pairs,
5226: the beauties in their flimsy dresses,
5227: the swarm, the glittering mob that presses,
5228: the ring of marriageable girls --
5229: bludgeon the sense; it faints and whirls.
5230: Here insolent prize-dandies wither
5231: all others with a waistcoat's set
5232: and an insouciant lorgnette.
5233: Hussars on leave are racing hither
5234: to boom, to flash across the sky,
5235: to captivate, and then to fly.
5236: LII
5237: The night has many stars that glitter,
5238: Moscow has beauties and to spare:
5239: but brighter than the heavenly litter,
5240: the moon in its azure of air.
5241: And yet that goddess whom I'd never
5242: importune with my lyre, whenever
5243: like a majestic moon, she drives
5244: among the maidens and the wives,
5245: how proudly, how divinely gleaming,
5246: she treads our earth, and how her breast
5247: is in voluptuous languor dressed,
5248: how sensuously her eyes are dreaming!
5249: Enough, I tell you, that will do --
5250: you've paid insanity its due.
5251: {202}
5252: LIII
5253: Noise, laughter, bowing, helter-skelter
5254: galop, mazurka, waltz... Meanwhile
5255: between two aunts, in pillared shelter,
5256: unnoticed, in unseeing style,
5257: Tanya looks on; her own indictment
5258: condemns the monde and its excitement;
5259: she finds it stifling here... she strains
5260: in dream toward the woods and plains,
5261: the country cottages and hovels,
5262: and to that far and lonely nook
5263: where flows a little glittering brook,
5264: to her flower-garden, to her novels, --
5265: to where he came to her that time
5266: in twilight of allées of lime.
5267: LIV
5268: But while she roams in thought, not caring
5269: for dance, and din, and worldly ways,
5270: a general of majestic bearing
5271: has fixed on her a steady gaze.
5272: The aunts exchanged a look, they fluttered,
5273: they nudged Tatyana, and each muttered
5274: at the same moment in her ear:
5275: ``Look quickly to the left, d'you hear?''
5276: ``Look to the left? where? what's the matter?''
5277: ``There, just in front of all that swarm,
5278: you see the two in uniform...
5279: just look, and never mind the chatter...
5280: he's moved... you see him from the side.''
5281: ``Who? that fat general?'' Tanya cried.
5282: {203}
5283: LV
5284: But here, with our congratulation
5285: on her conquest, we leave my sweet;
5286: I'm altering my destination
5287: lest in forgetfulness complete
5288: I drop my hero... I'll be truthful:
5289: ``It is a friend I sing, a youthful
5290: amateur of caprice and quirk.
5291: Muse of the epic, bless my work!
5292: in my long task, be my upholder,
5293: put a strong staff into my hand,
5294: don't let me stray in paths unplanned.''
5295: Enough. The load is off my shoulder!
5296: I've paid my due to classic art:
5297: it may be late, but it's a start.
5298: {204}
5299: Notes to Chapter Seven
5300: 1 Vasily Levshin (1746-1826), writer on gardening and agriculture.
5301: 2 Stanzas VIII and IX and XXXIX were discarded by Pushkin.
5302: 3 A statuette of Napoleon.
5303: 4 See note 1 to Chapter Five.
5304: --------
5305: Chapter Eight
5306: Fare thee well, and if for ever,
5307: Still for ever, fare thee well.
5308: Byron
5309: Days when I came to flower serenely
5310: in Lycée gardens long ago,
5311: and read my Apuleius keenly,
5312: but spared no glance for Cicero;
5313: yes, in that spring-time, in low-lying
5314: secluded vales, where swans were crying,
5315: by waters that were still and clear,
5316: for the first time the Muse came near.
5317: And suddenly her radiance lighted
5318: my student cell: she opened up
5319: the joys of youth, that festal cup,
5320: she sang of childhood's fun, indited
5321: Russia's old glories and their gleams,
5322: the heart and all its fragile dreams.
5323: {205}
5324: II
5325: And with a smile the world caressed us:
5326: what wings our first successes gave!
5327: aged Derzhávin1 saw and blessed us
5328: as he descended to the grave.
5329: ... ...
5330: III
5331: The arbitrary rules of passion
5332: were all the law that I would use;
5333: sharing her in promiscuous fashion,
5334: I introduced my saucy Muse
5335: to roar of banquets, din of brawling,
5336: when night patrol's a perilous calling;
5337: to each and every raving feast
5338: she brought her talents, never ceased,
5339: Bacchante-like, her flighty prancing;
5340: sang for the guests above the wine;
5341: the youth of those past days in line
5342: behind her followed wildly dancing;
5343: among my friends, in all that crowd
5344: my giddy mistress made me proud.
5345: {206}
5346: IV
5347: When I defected from their union
5348: and ran far off... the Muse came too.
5349: How often, with her sweet communion,
5350: she'd cheer my wordless way, and do
5351: her secret work of magic suasion!
5352: How often on the steep Caucasian
5353: ranges, Lenora2-like, she'd ride
5354: breakneck by moonlight at my side!
5355: How oft she'd lead me, by the Tauric
5356: seacoast, to hear in dark of night
5357: the murmuring Nereids recite,
5358: and the deep-throated billows' choric
5359: hymnal as, endlessly unfurled,
5360: they praise the Father of the world.
5361: V
5362: But then, oblivious of the city,
5363: its glaring feasts, and shrill events,
5364: in far Moldavia, fit for pity,
5365: she visited the humble tents
5366: of wandering tribesmen; while the ravage
5367: of their society turned her savage,
5368: she lost the language of the gods
5369: for the bleak tongue of boorish clods --
5370: she loved the steppe-land and its singing,
5371: then quickly something changed all this:
5372: look here, as a provincial miss
5373: she's turned up in my garden, bringing
5374: sad meditations in her look,
5375: and, in her hand, a small French book.
5376: {207}
5377: VI
5378: Now for the first time she's escorted
5379: into the social whirlabout;
5380: jealously, shyly, I've imported
5381: her steppeland charms into a rout.3
5382: Through the tight ranks -- aristocratic,
5383: military-foppish, diplomatic --
5384: past the grand ladies, see her glide;
5385: she sits down calmly on one side,
5386: admires the tumult and the pressing,
5387: the flickering tones of dress and speech,
5388: the young hostess, towards whom each
5389: new guest is gradually progressing,
5390: while men, all sombre, all the same,
5391: set off the ladies like a frame.
5392: VII
5393: She enjoys the stately orchestration
5394: of oligarchical converse,
5395: pride's icy calm, the combination
5396: of ranks and ages so diverse.
5397: But who stands there, in this selected
5398: assembly, silent and dejected?
5399: All who behold him find him strange.
5400: Faces before him flash and change
5401: like irksome phantoms, null as zero.
5402: Is spleen his trouble, or the dumb
5403: torment of pride? And why's he come?
5404: Who on earth is he? not... our hero?
5405: No doubt about it, it's Eugene.
5406: ``How long has he been on the scene?
5407: {208}
5408: VIII
5409: Still as he was? has he stopped prancing?
5410: does he still pose, and play the freak?
5411: Now he's returned, what role's he dancing?
5412: what play will he present this week?
5413: For what charade is he apparelled?
5414: Is he a Melmoth, a Childe Harold,
5415: a patriot, a cosmopolite,
5416: bigot or prude? or has he quite
5417: a different mask? is he becoming
5418: someone like you and me, just nice?
5419: At least I'll give him some advice:
5420: to drop all that old-fashioned mumming;
5421: too long he's hoaxed us high and low...''
5422: ``You know him, do you?'' ``Yes and no.''
5423: IX
5424: However has he earned so vicious,
5425: so unforgiving a report?
5426: Is it that we've become officious
5427: and prone to censure in our thought;
5428: that fiery souls' headstrong enthusing
5429: appears offensive or amusing
5430: to the complacent and the null;
5431: that wit embarrasses the dull;
5432: that we enjoy equating chatter
5433: with deeds; that dunces now and then
5434: take wing on spite; that serious men
5435: find, in the trivial, serious matter;
5436: that mediocre dress alone
5437: fits us as if it were our own?
5438: {209}
5439: X
5440: Blest he who in his youth was truly
5441: youthful, who ripened in his time,
5442: and, as the years went by, who duly
5443: grew hardened to life's frosty clime;
5444: who never learnt how dreamers babble;
5445: who never scorned the social rabble;
5446: at twenty, was a fop inbred,
5447: at thirty, lucratively wed;
5448: at fifty, would prolong the story
5449: by clearing every sort of debt;
5450: who, in good time, would calmly get
5451: fortune, and dignity, and glory,
5452: who all his life would garner praise
5453: as the perfection of our days!
5454: XI
5455: Alas, our youth was what we made it,
5456: something to fritter and to burn,
5457: when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,
5458: and it deceived us in return;
5459: when our sublimest aspiration,
5460: and all our fresh imagination,
5461: swiftly decayed beyond recall
5462: like foliage in the rotting fall.
5463: It's agony to watch the hollow
5464: sequence of dinners stretch away,
5465: to see life as a ritual play,
5466: and with the decorous throng to follow
5467: although one in no manner shares
5468: its views, its passions, or its cares!
5469: {210}
5470: XII
5471: To be a butt for the malicious
5472: is agony, if I may speak,
5473: and in the eyes of the judicious
5474: to pass for an affected freak,
5475: or for a lamentable manic,
5476: a monster of the gens Satanic,
5477: or for that Demon4 of my dream.
5478: Onegin -- now once more my theme --
5479: had killed his best friend in a duel;
5480: without a goal on which to fix,
5481: lived to the age of twenty-six;
5482: was finding leisure's vacuum cruel;
5483: and with no post, no work, no wife,
5484: had nothing to employ his life.
5485: XIII
5486: He was the slave of a tenacious,
5487: a restless urge for change of place
5488: (an attribute that's quite vexatious,
5489: though some support it with good grace).
5490: He's gone away and left his village,
5491: the solitude of woods and tillage,
5492: where every day a bloodstained shade
5493: had come to him in field and glade;
5494: started a life of pointless roaming,
5495: dogged by one feeling, only one --
5496: and soon his travels had begun,
5497: as all things did, to bore him; homing,
5498: like Chatsky,5 he arrived to fall
5499: direct from shipboard into ball.
5500: {211}
5501: XIV
5502: There came a murmur, for a fleeting
5503: moment the assembly seemed to shake...
5504: that lady the hostess was greeting,
5505: with the grand general in her wake --
5506: she was unhurried, unobtrusive,
5507: not cold, but also not effusive,
5508: no haughty stare around the press,
5509: no proud pretentions to success,
5510: no mannerism, no affectation,
5511: no artifices of the vain...
5512: No, all in her was calm and plain.
5513: She struck one as the incarnation --
5514: Shishkov,6 forgive me: I don't know
5515: the Russian for le comme il faut.
5516: XV
5517: Ladies came over, crossed to meet her,
5518: dowagers smiled as she went by;
5519: and bending deeply down to greet her
5520: men made their bows, and sought her eye;
5521: girls as they passed her spoke less loudly,
5522: and no one in the room so proudly
5523: raised nose and shoulders high and wide
5524: as did the general at her side.
5525: You'd never class her as a beauty;
5526: and yet in her you'd not detect --
5527: rigorously though you'd inspect --
5528: what London calls, with humble duty
5529: to fashion's absolute dictate,
5530: a vulgar touch. I can't translate.
5531: {212}
5532: XVI
5533: And yet, although it's past conveying,
5534: I really dote upon the word:
5535: it's new to us, beyond gainsaying;
5536: from the first moment it was heard
5537: it had its epigram-potential7...
5538: But let's return to our essential,
5539: that lady whose engaging charm
5540: so effortlessly can disarm.
5541: She sits with Nina8 at a table --
5542: bright Northern Cleopatra she:
5543: but you'll undoubtedly agree
5544: that marble Nina's proved unable
5545: to steal away her neighbour's light
5546: or dim her, dazzle as she might.
5547: XVII
5548: ``Can it be she?'' Eugene in wonder
5549: demanded. ``Yes, she looks... And yet...
5550: from deepest backwood, furthest under...''
5551: And every minute his lorgnette
5552: stays fixed and focused on a vision
5553: which has recalled, without precision,
5554: forgotten features. ``Can you say,
5555: prince, who in that dark-red béret,
5556: just there, is talking to the Spanish
5557: ambassador?'' In some surprise
5558: the prince looks at him, and replies:
5559: ``Wait, I'll present you -- but you banish
5560: yourself too long from social life.''
5561: ``But tell me who she is.'' ``My wife.''
5562: {213}
5563: XVIII
5564: ``You're married? No idea whatever...
5565: Since when is this?'' ``Two years or more.''
5566: ``To...?'' ``Larina.'' ``Tatyana? never!''
5567: ``She knows you?'' ``Why, we lived next door.''
5568: So to his wife for presentation
5569: the prince bring up his own relation
5570: and friend Evgeny. The princess
5571: gazes at him... and nonetheless,
5572: however much her soul has faltered,
5573: however strongly she has been
5574: moved and surprised, she stays serene,
5575: and nothing in her look is altered:
5576: her manner is no less contained;
5577: her bow, as calm and as restrained.
5578: XIX
5579: I don't mean that she never shivered,
5580: paled, flushed, or lost composure's grip --
5581: no, even her eyebrow never quivered,
5582: she never even bit her lip.
5583: However closely he inspected,
5584: there was no trace to be detected
5585: of the old Tatyana. Eugene tried
5586: to talk to her, but language died.
5587: How long he'd been here, was her query,
5588: and where had he arrived from, not
5589: from their own country? Then she shot
5590: across to her consort a weary
5591: regard, and slipped away for good, ...
5592: with Eugene frozen where he stood.
5593: {214}
5594: XX
5595: Was she the Tanya he'd exhorted
5596: in solitude, as at the start
5597: of this our novel we reported,
5598: in the far backwoods' deepest heart,
5599: to whom, in a fine flow of preaching,
5600: he had conveyed some moral teaching,
5601: from whom he'd kept a letter, where
5602: her heart had spoken, free as air,
5603: untouched by trace of inhibition,
5604: could it be she... or had he dreamed?
5605: the girl he'd scorned in what he deemed
5606: the modesty of her condition,
5607: could it be she, who just had turned
5608: away, so cool, so unconcerned?
5609: XXI
5610: Eugene forsakes the packed reception,
5611: and home he drives, deep-sunk in thought.
5612: By dreams now sad in their conception,
5613: now sweet, his slumbers are distraught.
5614: He wakes -- and who is this who writes him?
5615: Prince N. respectfully invites him
5616: to a soirée. ``My God! to her!...
5617: I'll go, I'll go!'' -- and in a stir
5618: a swift, polite reply is written.
5619: What ails him? he's in some strange daze!
5620: what moves along the hidden ways
5621: in one so slothful, so hard-bitten?
5622: vexation? vainness? heavens above,
5623: it can't be youth's distemper -- love?
5624: {215}
5625: XXII
5626: Once more he counts the hour-bells tolling,
5627: once more he can't await the night;
5628: now ten has struck, his wheels are rolling,
5629: he drives there like a bird in flight,
5630: he's up the steps, with heart a-quiver
5631: led to the princess, all a-shiver,
5632: finds her alone, and there they sit
5633: some minutes long. The words won't fit
5634: on Eugene's lips. In his dejection,
5635: his awkwardness, he's hardly said
5636: a single thing to her. His head
5637: is lost in obstinate reflection;
5638: and obstinate his look. But she
5639: sits imperturbable, and free.
5640: XXIII
5641: Her husband enters, thus concluding
5642: their unattractive tête-à-tête;
5643: he and Onegin start alluding
5644: to pranks and jokes of earlier date.
5645: They laugh. The guests begin arriving.
5646: Already now the talk was thriving
5647: on modish malice, coarse of grain
5648: but salt; near the princess a vein
5649: of unaffectedly fantastic
5650: invention sparkled, then gave way
5651: to reasoned talk, no dull hearsay,
5652: no deathless truths, nothing scholastic;
5653: and no one's ear could take offence
5654: at such vivacious, free good sense.
5655: {216}
5656: XXIV
5657: High rank, of course, and fashion's glasses,
5658: Saint Petersburg's fine flower was there --
5659: the inevitable silly asses,
5660: the faces met with everywhere;
5661: ladies of riper years, delicious
5662: in rose-trimmed bonnets, but malicious;
5663: a girl or two, without a smile
5664: to crack between them; for a while
5665: one listened to a chief of mission
5666: on state affairs; there was a wit,
5667: a grey-haired, perfumed exquisite,
5668: a joker in the old tradition,
5669: acute and subtle -- in a word
5670: all that today we find absurd.
5671: XXV
5672: There, with epigrammatic neatness,
5673: was one who raged and raged again,
5674: against the tea's excessive sweetness,
5675: the boring wives, the ill-bred men,
5676: a novel, vague and superficial,
5677: two sisters who'd received the initial,9
5678: the lies that in the press run rife,
5679: the war, the snowfall, and his wife.
5680: ... ...
5681: {217}
5682: XXVI
5683: There was -- --,10 so notorious
5684: through baseness of the soul that he,
5685: in albums, blunted the censorious
5686: cartoonist-pencils of Saint-Priest;11
5687: another of the ball-dictators,
5688: a fashion-plate for illustrators,
5689: stood in the door, cherubic, mute,
5690: frozen in his tight-fitting suit;
5691: a far-flung traveller who was creaking
5692: with foppery and too much starch,
5693: set the guests smiling at his arch,
5694: affected pose -- and an unspeaking
5695: unanimous exchange of looks
5696: entered his sentence in the books.
5697: XXVII
5698: But my Eugene that night directed
5699: his gaze at Tatyana alone --
5700: not the plain, timorous, dejected
5701: and lovelorn maiden whom he'd known,
5702: but the unbending goddess-daughter
5703: of Neva's proud imperial water,
5704: the imperturbable princess.
5705: We all resemble more or less
5706: our Mother Eve: we're never falling
5707: for what's been given us to take;
5708: to his mysterious tree the snake
5709: is calling us, for ever calling --
5710: and once forbidden fruit is seen,
5711: no paradise can stay serene.
5712: {218}
5713: XXVIII
5714: In Tanya, what a transformation!
5715: how well she'd studied her new role!
5716: how soon the bounds of rank and station
5717: had won her loyalty! What soul
5718: would have divined the tender, shrinking
5719: maiden in this superb, unthinking
5720: lawgiver to the modish world?
5721: Yet once for him her thoughts had whirled,
5722: for him, at night, before the indulgence
5723: of Morpheus had induced relief
5724: she once had pined in girlish grief,
5725: raised a dull eye to moon's refulgence,
5726: and dreamt that she with him one day
5727: jointly would tread life's humble way!
5728: XXIX
5729: Love tyrannises all the ages;
5730: but youthful, virgin hearts derive
5731: a blessing from its blasts and rages,
5732: like fields in spring when storms arrive.
5733: In passion's sluicing rain they freshen,
5734: ripen, and find a new expression --
5735: the vital force gives them the shoot
5736: of sumptuous flowers and luscious fruit.
5737: But when a later age has found us,
5738: the climacteric of our life,
5739: how sad the scar of passion's knife:
5740: as when chill autumn rains surround us,
5741: throw meadows into muddy rout,
5742: and strip the forest round about.
5743: {219}
5744: XXX
5745: Alas, Eugene beyond all query
5746: is deep in love, just like a boy;
5747: spends light and darkness in the dreary
5748: brooding that is the lover's ploy.
5749: Each day, despite the appeals of reason,
5750: he drives up in and out of season
5751: to her glass porch; pursues her round
5752: close as a shadow on the ground;
5753: and bliss for him is when he hotly
5754: touches her hand, or throws a fur
5755: around her neck, or when for her
5756: he goes ahead and parts the motley
5757: brigade of liveries in the hall,
5758: or else lifts up a fallen shawl.
5759: XXXI
5760: But she refuses to perceive him,
5761: even if he drops or pines away.
5762: At home she'll equably receive him,
5763: in others' houses she may say
5764: a word or two, or stare unseeing,
5765: or simply bow: within her being
5766: coquettishness has got no trace --
5767: the grand monde finds it out of place.
5768: Meanwhile Onegin starts to languish:
5769: she doesn't see, or doesn't mind;
5770: Onegin wastes, you'd almost find
5771: he's got consumption. In his anguish
5772: some vote a doctor for the case,
5773: others prescribe a watering-place.
5774: {220}
5775: XXXII
5776: But go he won't: for him, a letter
5777: fixing an early rendezvous
5778: with his forefathers would seem better;
5779: but she (for women, that's not new)
5780: remains unmoved: still he's persistent,
5781: active, and hopeful, and insistent:
5782: his illness lends him courage and
5783: to the princess, in his weak hand,
5784: he sends a letter, penned with passion.
5785: He deemed, in general, letters vain,
5786: and rightly so, but now his pain
5787: had gone in no uncertain fashion
5788: past all endurance. You're referred
5789: to Eugene's letter, word for word.
5790: {221}
5791: Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
5792: ``I know it all: my secret ache
5793: will anger you in its confession.
5794: What scorn I see in the expression
5795: that your proud glance is sure to take!
5796: What do I want? what am I after,
5797: stripping my soul before your eyes!
5798: I know to what malicious laughter
5799: my declaration may give rise!
5800: ``I noticed once, at our chance meeting,
5801: in you a tender pulse was beating,
5802: yet dared not trust what I could see.
5803: I gave no rein to sweet affection:
5804: what held me was my predilection,
5805: my tedious taste for feeling free.
5806: And then, to part us in full measure,
5807: Lensky, that tragic victim, died...
5808: From all sweet things that gave me pleasure,
5809: since then my heart was wrenched aside;
5810: freedom and peace, in substitution
5811: for happiness, I sought, and ranged
5812: unloved, and friendless, and estranged.
5813: What folly! and what retribution!
5814: ``No, every minute of my days,
5815: to see you, faithfully to follow,
5816: watch for your smile, and catch your gaze
5817: with eyes of love, with greed to swallow
5818: your words, and in my soul to explore
5819: your matchlessness, to seek to capture
5820: its image, then to swoon before
5821: your feet, to pale and waste... what rapture!
5822: {222}
5823: ``But I'm denied this: all for you
5824: I drag my footsteps hither, yonder;
5825: I count each hour the whole day through;
5826: and yet in vain ennui I squander
5827: the days that doom has measured out.
5828: And how they weigh! I know about
5829: my span, that fortune's jurisdiction
5830: has fixed; but for my heart to beat
5831: I must wake up with the conviction
5832: that somehow that same day we'll meet...
5833: ``I dread your stern regard surmising
5834: in my petition an approach,
5835: a calculation past despising --
5836: I hear the wrath of your reproach.
5837: How fearful, in and out of season
5838: to pine away from passion's thirst,
5839: to burn -- and then by force of reason
5840: to stem the bloodstream's wild outburst;
5841: how fearful, too, is my obsession
5842: to clasp your knees, and at your feet
5843: to sob out prayer, complaint, confession,
5844: and every plea that lips can treat;
5845: meanwhile with a dissembler's duty
5846: to cool my glances and my tongue,
5847: to talk as if with heart unwrung,
5848: and look serenely on your beauty!...
5849: ``But so it is: I'm in no state
5850: to battle further with my passion;
5851: I'm yours, in a predestined fashion,
5852: and I surrender to my fate.''
5853: {223}
5854: XXXIII
5855: No answer comes. Another letter
5856: he sends, a second, then a third.
5857: No answer comes. He goes, for better
5858: or worse, to a soirée. Unheard
5859: she appears before him, grim and frozen.
5860: No look, no word for him: she's chosen
5861: to encase herself inside a layer
5862: of Twelfth Night's chillest, iciest air.
5863: To batten down their indignation
5864: is all those stubborn lips desire!
5865: Onegin looks with eyes of fire:
5866: where are distress, commiseration?
5867: No tearstains, nothing. Wrath alone
5868: is graven on that face of stone.
5869: XXXIV
5870: Perhaps some secret apprehension
5871: lest signs of casual weakness drew
5872: her husband's or the world's attention...
5873: Ah, all that my Onegin knew...
5874: No hope! no hope! He leaves the revel,
5875: wishes his madness to the devil,
5876: drives home -- and plunging deeper in,
5877: once more renounces world and din.
5878: And he remembers, in the quiet
5879: of his own room, how cruel spleen
5880: had once before, across the scene
5881: of social buzz and modish riot,
5882: tracked him, and put him in duress,
5883: and locked him in a dark recess.
5884: {224}
5885: XXXV
5886: Once more he turned to books, unchoosing,
5887: devouring Gibbon and Rousseau,
5888: Manzoni and Chamfort,12 perusing
5889: Madame de Staël, Bichat,13 Tissot,14
5890: Herder, and even at times a Russian --
5891: nothing was barred beyond discussion --
5892: he read of course the sceptic Bayle15
5893: and all the works of Fontanelle16 --
5894: almanacs, journals of reflection,
5895: where admonitions are pronounced,
5896: where nowadays I'm soundly trounced,
5897: but where such hymns in my direction
5898: were chanted, I remember when --
5899: e sempre bene, gentlemen.
5900: XXXVI
5901: What happened? Though his eyes were reading,
5902: his thoughts were on a distant goal:
5903: desires and dreams and griefs were breeding
5904: and swarming in his inmost soul.
5905: Between the lines of text as printed,
5906: his mind's eye focused on the hinted
5907: purport of other lines; intense
5908: was his absorption in their sense.
5909: Legends, and mystical traditions,
5910: drawn from a dim, warm-hearted past,
5911: dreams of inconsequential cast,
5912: rumours and threats and premonitions,
5913: long, lively tales from wonderland,
5914: or letters in a young girl's hand.
5915: {225}
5916: XXXVII
5917: Then gradually upon sensation,
5918: and thought, a sleepy numbness steals;
5919: before his eyes, imagination
5920: brings out its faro pack, and deals.
5921: He sees: in slush, stretched out and keeping
5922: motionless as one soundly sleeping
5923: in bed, a young man, stiff and chilled;
5924: he hears a voice; ``well, what? he's killed!''
5925: And foes he sees, long-since forgotten,
5926: a rogue, a slanderer, a poltroon,
5927: young traitresses by the platoon,
5928: comrades despised, and comrades rotten;
5929: a country house -- and one who still
5930: sits there beside the window-sill!
5931: XXXVIII
5932: He got so used to this immersion,
5933: he almost lost his mind, expired,
5934: or joined us poets. His conversion
5935: would have been all that we required!
5936: It's true, the magnet-like attraction
5937: of Russian verse, its force in action, --
5938: my inept pupil, at that hour,
5939: so nearly had them in his power.
5940: Who could have looked the poet better,
5941: as in the nook he'd sit alone
5942: by blazing fireplace, and intone
5943: Idol mio or Benedetta,
5944: and on the flames let fall unseen
5945: a slipper, or a magazine?
5946: {226}
5947: XXXIX
5948: The days flew past; by now the season
5949: in warmer airs was half dispersed.
5950: He's neither died, nor lost his reason,
5951: nor turned a poet. In the burst
5952: of spring he lives, he's energetic;
5953: he leaves one morning the hermetic
5954: apartment where a double glaze
5955: has kept him warm in chimney's blaze
5956: while, marmot-like, he hibernated --
5957: along the Neva in a sleigh,
5958: past ice-blocks, blue and squared away,
5959: he drives in brilliant sun; striated
5960: along the street lies dirty snow;
5961: and like an arrow from a bow
5962: XL
5963: over the slush, where is he chasing?
5964: You've guessed before it all began:
5965: to his Tatyana, yes, he's racing,
5966: my strange, incorrigible man.
5967: He goes inside, corpse-like of feature...
5968: the hall's without a living creature,
5969: the big room, further, not a cat.
5970: He opens up a door. What's that
5971: that strikes him with such force and meaning?
5972: The princess, sitting peaked and wan,
5973: alone, with no adornment on;
5974: she holds a letter up, and leaning
5975: cheek upon hand she softly cries
5976: in a still stream that never dries.
5977: {227}
5978: XLI
5979: Who in that flash could not have reckoned
5980: her full account of voiceless pain?
5981: Who in the princess for that second
5982: would not have recognized again
5983: our hapless Tanya! An emotion
5984: of wild repentance and devotion
5985: threw Eugene at her feet -- she stirred,
5986: and looked at him without a word,
5987: without surprise or rage... his laden,
5988: his humbly suppliant approach,
5989: his dull, sick look, his dumb reproach --
5990: she sees it all. The simple maiden,
5991: whose heart on dreams was wont to thrive,
5992: in her once more has come alive.
5993: XLII
5994: Tatyana leaves Onegin kneeling,
5995: looks at him with a steady gaze,
5996: allows her hand, that's lost all feeling,
5997: to meet his thirsty lips... What daze,
5998: what dream accounts for her distraction?
5999: A pause of silence and inaction,
6000: then quietly at last says she:
6001: ``Enough, stand up. It's now for me
6002: to give you honest explanation.
6003: Onegin, d'you recall the day
6004: when in the park, in the allée
6005: where fate had fixed our confrontation,
6006: humbly I heard your lesson out?
6007: Today it's turn and turn about.
6008: {228}
6009: XLIII
6010: ``For then, Onegin, I was younger,
6011: and also prettier, I'll be bound,
6012: what's more, I loved you; but my hunger,
6013: what was it in your heart it found
6014: that could sustain it? Only grimness;
6015: for you, I think, the humble dimness
6016: of lovelorn girls was nothing new?
6017: But now -- oh God! -- the thought of you,
6018: your icy look, your stern dissuasion,
6019: freezes my blood... Yet all the same,
6020: nothing you did gave cause for blame:
6021: you acted well, that dread occasion,
6022: you took an honourable part --
6023: I'm grateful now with all my heart.
6024: XLIV
6025: ``Then, in the backwoods, far from rumour
6026: and empty gossip, you'll allow,
6027: I'd nothing to attract your humour...
6028: Why then do you pursue me now?
6029: What cause has won me your attention?
6030: Could it not be that by convention
6031: I move in the grand monde? that rank,
6032: and riches, and the wish to thank
6033: my husband for his wounds in battle
6034: earn us the favour of the Court?
6035: that, for all this, my shame's report
6036: would cause widespread remark and tattle,
6037: and so in the salons could make
6038: a tempting plume for you to take?
6039: {229}
6040: XLV
6041: ``I weep... In case there still should linger
6042: your Tanya's image in your mind,
6043: then know that your reproving finger,
6044: your cold discourse, were less unkind --
6045: if I had power to choose your fashion --
6046: than this humiliating passion
6047: and than these letters, and these tears.
6048: At least you then showed for my years
6049: respect, and mercy for my dreaming.
6050: But now! what brings you to my feet?
6051: What trifling could be more complete?
6052: What power enslaves you, with your seeming
6053: advantages of heart and brain,
6054: to all that's trivial and inane?
6055: XLVI
6056: ``To me, Onegin, all this glory
6057: is tinsel on a life I hate;
6058: this modish whirl, this social story,
6059: my house, my evenings, all that state --
6060: what's in them? All this loud parading,
6061: and all this flashy masquerading,
6062: the glare, the fumes in which I live,
6063: this very day I'd gladly give,
6064: give for a bookshelf, a neglected
6065: garden, a modest home, the place
6066: of our first meeting face to face,
6067: and the churchyard where, new-erected,
6068: a humble cross, in woodland gloom,
6069: stands over my poor nurse's tomb.
6070: {230}
6071: XLVII
6072: ``Bliss was so near, so altogether
6073: attainable!... But now my lot
6074: is firmly cast. I don't know whether
6075: I acted thoughtlessly or not:
6076: you see, with tears and incantation
6077: mother implored me; my sad station
6078: made all fates look the same... and so
6079: I married. I beseech you, go;
6080: I know your heart: it has a feeling
6081: for honour, a straightforward pride.
6082: I love you (what's the use to hide
6083: behind deceit or double-dealing?)
6084: but I've become another's wife --
6085: and I'll be true to him, for life.''
6086: XLVIII
6087: She went -- and Eugene, all emotion,
6088: stood thunder-struck. In what wild round
6089: of tempests, in what raging ocean
6090: his heart was plunged! A sudden sound,
6091: the clink of rowels, met his hearing;
6092: Tatyana's husband, now appearing...
6093: But from the hero of my tale,
6094: just at this crisis of his gale,
6095: reader, we must be separating,
6096: for long... for evermore. We've chased
6097: him far enough through wild and waste.
6098: Hurrah! let's start congratulating
6099: ourselves on our landfall. It's true,
6100: our vessel's long been overdue.
6101: {231}
6102: XLIX
6103: Reader, I wish that, as we parted --
6104: whoever you may be, a friend,
6105: a foe -- our mood should be warm-hearted.
6106: Goodbye, for now we make an end.
6107: Whatever in this rough confection
6108: you sought -- tumultuous recollection,
6109: a rest from toil and all its aches,
6110: or just grammatical mistakes,
6111: a vivid brush, a witty rattle --
6112: God grant that from this little book
6113: for heart's delight, or fun, you took,
6114: for dreams, or journalistic battle,
6115: God grant you took at least a grain.
6116: On this we'll part; goodbye again!
6117: L
6118: And my companion, so mysterious,
6119: goodbye to you, my true ideal,
6120: my task, so vivid and so serious
6121: and yet so light. All that is real
6122: and enviable for a poet,
6123: in your pursuit I've come to know it:
6124: oblivion of life's stormy ways,
6125: sweet talk with friends. How many days
6126: since, through the mist that dreams arise on,
6127: young Tanya first appeared to me,
6128: Onegin too -- and there to see,
6129: a free romance's far horizon,
6130: still dim, through crystal's magic glass,
6131: before my gaze began to pass.
6132: {232}
6133: LI
6134: Of those who heard my opening pages
6135: in friendly gatherings where I read,
6136: as Sadi17 sang in earlier ages,
6137: ``some are far distant, some are dead''.
6138: They've missed Eugene's completed etching.
6139: But she who modelled for the sketching
6140: of Tanya's image... Ah, how great
6141: the toll of those borne off by fate!
6142: Blest he who's left the hurly-burly
6143: of life's repast betimes, nor sought
6144: to drain its beaker down, nor thought
6145: of finishing its book, but early
6146: has wished it an abrupt goodbye --
6147: and, with my Eugene, so have I.
6148: {233}
6149: Notes to Chapter Eight
6150: 1 Gavrila  Derzhávin  (1745-1816), ``Russia's first outstanding  poet''

6152: some of his verses to him. The stanza was unfinished.
6153: 2 Lenore, romantic ballad by Gottfried August Bürger, 1773.

6158: 6 Admiral Alexander Shishkov (1754-1841)  championed the purity ot  the

6161: work.
6162: 8 Nina Voronskoy, imaginary belle of Petersburg society.
6163: 9 Court  decoration given  to  the Empress's ladies-in-waiting.  Stanza
